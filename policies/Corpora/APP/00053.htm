While you may encounter links on the Site to other websites, such as those relating to our third party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners (e.g., our affiliate network operators), please note that these websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement (unless otherwise noted on such site, which may be the case if, for example, the site is also owned and operated by Forbes). </p>\n\n<p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to the activities of Forbes’ third party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners (e.g. our affiliate network operators) that may collect your user information while you access or use such third party’s services in connection with your use of our Site (e.g. social media and sharing services).  The privacy and information practices of those third parties are not covered by this Privacy Statement.  To learn more about such third party policies, we encourage you to read and review the privacy statements of each third party service that you may choose to use. This Privacy Statement applies only to user information collected by us. </p>\n\n<p>As a general reminder, please think carefully before you decide to put anything on the internet.  For example, if you voluntarily disclose user information in chat areas or bulletin boards (e.g., comments sections), that information could be seen and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages from others. We are not responsible for the user information you may choose to submit in these public forums. To request removal of your user information from our blog or community forum, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, for legal retention purposes or technical limitations (e.g., the data may not be searchable), we may not be able to remove user information voluntarily disclosed by you in such forums, in which case, we will notify you. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"gathering-info\"><u>Gathering of Information</u></h4>\n\n<p><b>Section Overview</b>: We collect user information when you use the Site.  Sometimes you may submit it to us yourself, other times it may be collected automatically. You can manage and change your preferences as outlined below.</p>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"info-collected\">Information Collected</h4>\n\n<p>When you use the Site, your user information may be collected, used, and shared in a variety of manners. \nAs detailed below, the type of user information collected may vary based on how it was gathered, but may include, among other things, user information that you voluntarily submit (e.g., when setting up an account or submitting a registration or application on the Site, you may submit your contact information, social media account handles, and/or professional information), user information automatically collected about your usage of the Site (e.g., the content that you choose to view), and user information that our third party partners may share with us if such third party partners have previously received your consent to do so.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"voluntary-submission\">Voluntary Submission</h4>\n\n<p>Forbes may collect user information (including personally identifiable information) that is voluntarily provided by you or with your permission.  For example, we may ask you for user information, such as your email address, when you register to become a member of the Site or register for a Forbes-produced live event. You may also provide user information to Forbes in other contexts, including, for example, on your member profile page and public profile URL, to enter into a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion, or to apply for consideration in connection with a Forbes list or similar accolade (e.g., Under 30 list applications). In the event you order something from the Site or one of our co-branded websites, we may request additional user information, such as your address, telephone number and credit card information, in order to complete the purchase. You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services. In the event that you wish to provide user information to us about a third party, such your friend or colleague, in connection with a referral, recommendation, nomination (e.g., Under 30 list nomination), or other purpose, please only do so if you have the permission of that third party. When you register or become a member of the Site or provide information to Forbes in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"collect-automatically\">Information that We Collect Automatically</h4>\n\n<p>When you visit our Site, we may collect certain user information automatically from your device.

Certain cookies are used for specific purposes that are essential to your secure use and navigation of the Site.  Without them, Forbes may not be able to provide core Site functions and features to you, and the Site would not operate as well as you or Forbes would like.  These cookies collect and use information such as your server preferences, single-session data and corresponding identifier, web beacons and log files (detailed below), and other credential-related information.  </p>\n\n<p>Functional Cookies.  Other cookies may be used to collect and process information about your preferences and similar choices in connection with the Site in order to optimize your browsing experience (e.g., various local preference settings; which geographically-customized version of the Site and related content you may prefer e.g., Forbes US, Forbes Asia, Forbes Europe).  Functional cookies include social media cookies, which collect information about your social media usage and other data you may have provided in connection with such usage (if you access the Site through a social media website or mobile application, you may have social media cookies).  If you wish to modify or change your social media cookies, please visit and review the settings on your applicable social media account(s). Functional cookies also include analytics cookies, which provide us with data that allows Forbes to better understand its users and improve the Site based on what we have learned from that data.</p>\n\n<p>Advertising Cookies.  To help support the Site and further tailor your experience, Forbes and its advertising partners (and/or their third-party analytics providers) may also use cookies on the Site to personalize the content and advertisements you may be shown.  Such advertisements use cookies to provide you targeted advertisements that may be more consistent with your interests than non-targeted advertisements.  Certain Forbes advertising partners may also use cookies to monitor or track the performance of their advertising content, including native advertising content (e.g., BrandVoice).  Forbes does not provide user information to advertising partners except in connection with the Site or as required by law.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to manage your cookie preferences or learn more information about this practice and your right to decline (or opt-out of) cookies placed by some or all of these companies, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/\">click here</a>.

We may also include web beacons in our email communications, including newsletters, in order to measure engagement with our communications (e.g., to count how many, and when, email communications have been opened, or which links in such communications have been clicked on).</p>\n\n<p>Forbes and its partners (including advertisers, ad servers, and affiliate link e-commerce providers) may also use web beacons to collect various data provided by your browser while you are on our Site and elsewhere (i.e., outside of the Site) where we may be acting as a third party. This data is collected in the aggregate, but may include or be associated with other user information that users have voluntarily submitted.  As we do not control or have access to the manner in which these third parties may use cookies or other tracking technologies, Forbes is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties (if you have questions about any of these third parties, we encourage you to review their corresponding privacy policies).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"log-files\">Log Files</h4>\n\n<p>The Site’s web and ad servers log information about a user's IP address, browser type and the current URL the user is requesting.
