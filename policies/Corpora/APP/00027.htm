						<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
                        <p>Last Updated: February 3, 2016</p>
                        <p>Sanofi US (Sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC and Sanofi US Services Inc.) respect the interest that visitors to our websites have in understanding what information is collected electronically, how it is collected, to whom it is or may be disclosed and how it is used. Sanofi US has developed this online privacy policy to address those questions.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware that Sanofi US is not a healthcare provider (e.g. doctor, hospital, pharmacist, etc.) and therefore is generally not subject to the Privacy Rule under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To the extent that HIPAA imposes requirements on healthcare providers relating to individually identifiable healthcare information, those requirements may not apply to Sanofi US.</p>
                        <strong>This Policy Includes:</strong>
                        <ul>

                        <strong>Important limitations to this online Privacy Policy</strong>
                        <ul>
							<li>This policy addresses only information that is or may be collected on our U.S. websites – <strong><i>which are NOT intended to be used by non-U.S. residents.</i></strong></li>
                            <li>This policy applies only to information collected on websites that are directly linked to this policy, and does not apply to information collected in other areas, whether online or offline. This policy does not apply to third-party websites that may be accessed through a link from a site covered by this policy. You should review the privacy policies of any third-party websites to understand how that site collects, uses and discloses any Personal Information or non-Personal Information (as defined below).</li>
                            <li>Our U.S. websites are not intended for, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 13, or to collect Personal Information (as defined below) from children either directly or through passive information technology such as cookies. If a parent or guardian has reason to believe that a child has provided us with Personal Information (as defined below), the parent or guardian should contact us at 800-633-1610.</li>
                            <li>This policy does not apply to information collected through applications on mobile or personal devices, even if the application may be accessed through a link from a site covered by this policy.</li>
                         </ul>
                         
                         <p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br />
                         “Personal Information” is information that directly identifies you or could reasonably be used in combination with other information to identify you and which is submitted to and/or collected by Sanofi US web sites and maintained by or for Sanofi US in an accessible form. Examples of Personal Information that directly identify you can include your name, driver’s license number, social security number, biometric or genetic data, street address, telephone number, email address and other similar information. Examples of Personal Information that when combined with other information may be able to identify you include race, gender, date of birth, health condition or status, employment status, zip code and other similar information. Both types of information are considered “Personal Information” for the purposes of this policy.</p>
                        <p>Please do not submit any Personal Information if you do not want it to be collected. You should be aware, however, that without providing requested information, you may not be able to participate in particular features or activities that require such information.</p>
                         <p>Certain areas of our websites allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments or other information. Please be aware that when you ask questions or provide comments or other information, you may be disclosing Personal Information.</p>
                         <p>Non-Personal Information is information that is not personal, such as questions, comments, ideas and suggestions that you provide, or information that we may collect that is not linked to any Personal Information. Non-Personal Information will be treated as non-confidential, and we may disclose and/or use that information without any obligation whatsoever to you, for any purpose and through any means.</p>
                         
                         <p><strong>How Personal Information may be used</strong><br />
                         If you provide us with Personal Information, we may use that information to contact you by e-mail, regular mail, telephone or other means, to provide you with information you requested about specific products or services, provide additional future information about products or services that may be of interest to you, and to learn about and develop products and services concerning a particular disease or condition (e.g. market research). Other or additional information about use of your Personal Information may appear at the point where you are asked to provide Personal Information in a form or data field.</p>
                         <p>Sanofi US may combine your Personal Information provided on one Sanofi US web site with Personal Information provided in other online or offline records held by Sanofi US, and/or with records provided by third parties. Sanofi US may also combine your Personal Information with information gathered through cookies, web logs, pixel tags and other visitor tracking technologies, discussed further below. We use this consolidated information to help us better design Sanofi US websites and products, to communicate information to you, to enhance our marketing and research activities, and to facilitate other business functions.</p>
                         
                         <p><strong>Who Personal Information may be disclosed to</strong><br />
                         Sanofi US will not transfer or allow access to your Personal Information to third parties, except (i) to affiliated entities within the Sanofi Group, whether inside the U.S. or in other countries; (ii) to vendors and service providers who provide services to us (e.g., market research) or who assist us in providing service to you (e.g. a fulfillment company for processing and mailing purposes); (iii) in connection with security related or law enforcement investigations or in the course of cooperating with authorities; (iv) to comply with legal requirements or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (v) when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to assist in an investigation regarding, or to prevent, illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person; (v) upon a sale, merger, assignment or transfer of the business of the website to which the information relates; and (vi) to third parties with whom Sanofi US is jointly marketing a product or service or jointly conducting a program or activity. Any affiliated entity, vendor or service provider, or other third party who is permitted access to, or to whom we transfer, Personal Information is required to keep your Personal Information confidential.</p>
                         
                         <p><strong>Security</strong><br />
                         Sanofi US takes reasonable precautions to keep Personal Information secure against unauthorized access and use. However, the confidentiality of personal information transmitted over the Internet cannot be guaranteed. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting personal information over the Internet, especially Personal Information related to your health. Sanofi US cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Information; therefore, when submitting personal information to Sanofi US websites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.</p>
                         
                         <p><strong>Visitor tracking information</strong><br />
                         <i>Cookies</i><br />
                         Sanofi US websites may use a tracking technology called a “cookie.” A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site, to track your preferences and selections, or to show you advertisements based on your interests, such as banner ads relating to Sanofi US products and services. Cookies may be placed on your computer by Sanofi US (a “first party cookie”) or by another company or advertiser that Sanofi US engages to provide services or advertising on a Sanofi US website (a “third party cookie”). It is possible that these cookies could be used in combination with other information to identify you.</p>
                         <p>Information stored in first party cookies associated with a Sanofi US web site will be transmitted back to us. Information stored in third party cookies may be transmitted to the party placing the cookie, so that they can deliver to you messages and advertisements based on your interests as you browse the Internet. You may be able to opt-out of third parties using cookies to deliver interest-based advertising to you by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices/. With most internet browsers, you can also erase cookies from your computer’s hard drive, block all cookies, block specific kinds of cookies, or even receive a warning before a cookie is placed on your system. Refer to your browser instructions or help button to learn more about cookies. You should be aware, however, that cookies might be necessary to provide you with certain features (e.g. customized delivery of information) available on Sanofi US websites. In addition, certain web browsers and other programs may be used to signal your preferences to Sanofi US about how or whether Sanofi US or third parties may collect information about your online activities. Currently, Sanofi US does not respond to such signals.</p>
                         
                         <p><i>Web Logs</i><br />
                         Sanofi US websites may also automatically collect and store web log information relating to your computer and your visit, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet address of the website from which you linked to a Sanofi US website; the date and time you accessed a Sanofi US website, how long you spent and which pages you visited; your computer's operating system and browser software; and your Internet protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider so you can access the Internet. This number may change each time you connect to the internet (“dynamic IP address”) or it may remain constant (“static IP address”). If you have a static IP address, it is possible that this address could be used in combination with other information to identify you.</p>
                         
                          <p><i>Pixel Tags</i><br />
                          Sanofi US websites may also track your usage of the site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs or web beacons). A pixel tag is a tiny graphic on a web page that is used to track pages viewed. Pixel tags tell the web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Pixel tags may be placed on online advertisements that bring people to a Sanofi US website and on different pages of our sites. Web beacons provide us with information on how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.</p>
                          
                           <p><i>Social Plugins</i><br />
                          This site may use social plugins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our site, the operator of the social plugin may be able to place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our site. If you are logged into the associated social media web site (e.g., Facebook) while browsing on our web site, the social plugin allows that social media web site to receive information that you have visited our web site. The social plugin may also allow the social media web site to share information about your activities on our web site with other users of their social media web site. For more information about the information shared via a particular social media plugin, you should refer to that social media site’s privacy statement.</p>
                          
                           <p><i>Google Analytics</i><br />
                          Some of our websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze use patterns and may collect information about your use of the website, including your IP address. More information on Google Analytics can be found <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" class="osw-link-modal-external osw-initialized" title="google Analyrics policies in a new window" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                          
                           <p><strong>How to stop getting communications</strong><br />
                           If you decide you no longer wish to receive information or communications about particular products and services, or from Sanofi US (for example, postal mailings, emails and telephone calls), you may opt out of any particular product or service or from all mailings by contacting us at the following toll-free number: 800-633-1610 . An “unsubscribe” option is also available through the Sanofi US website <a href="https://unsubscribe.sanofi-aventis.us/" title="Sanofi-aventis.us (New window)" target="_blank">here.</a><br />
                           You may also click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any Sanofi US email and follow the directions that appear on the screen in order to opt out of communications from Sanofi US.</p>
                           <p>Please note that you may continue to receive materials for a period of time while our lists are being updated.</p>
                           
                           <p><strong>How may I correct or delete Personal Information?</strong><br />
   You may request that we remove your Personal Information from our current customer records or that we amend your Personal Information. Please notify us of your wishes by contacting us at 800-633-1610, toll-free. For record keeping purposes, we may retain certain Personal Information you submit in conjunction with commercial transactions.</p>
                           
                           <p><strong>Updates to this Privacy Policy</strong><br />
                           Without prejudice to your rights under applicable law, Sanofi US reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy without prior notice to reflect technological advancements, legal and regulatory changes and good business practices. If Sanofi US changes its privacy practices, an updated version of this Privacy Policy will reflect those changes and we will notify you of such changes by updating the effective date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                           <p>Thank you for your interest in Sanofi US.</p>
