Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Site. This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use, available at <a href="http://www.regentis.co.il/"><i><u>www.painreform.com</u></i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you share with us.</p>

<p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, pen name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information.</p>

<p>Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to information available on our Site.</p>

<p><b>The Way We Use Personal Information</b></p>

<p>If you submit Personal Information to us through the Site, then we will use your Personal Information to improve our services to you, to contact you and to identify and authenticate your access to the Sites services that you are authorized to access.</p>

<p>We may transfer your Personal Information within Painreform or to Painreform&#39;s third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site or to you, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>

<p>We may provide Personal Information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

<p>Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, ii) enforce our Terms of Use including investigations of potential violations thereof, iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Painreform, its users, yourself or the public.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b></p>

<p>Some of our Site pages utilize &quot;cookies&quot; and other tracking technologies. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.</p>

<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter certain identifying information, should we in the future require such information, to gain access to certain parts of the Site.</p>

<p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Site and your web experience.</p>

<p><b>Notice</b></p>

<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not currently provide your Personal Information to third parties, except for third parties who may perform services on the Site or to you. Nevertheless, we may at a later time choose to make certain offers or services available to our users from third parties. If we do, during the registration process and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, we may ask you whether your Personal Information may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, your Personal Information (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to our Site) may be shared with data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations. Painreform does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Painreforms behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your Personal Information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information that can identify an individual user.</p>

<p><b>Choice</b></p>

<p>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Painreform. The notices we will provide where Painreform collects Personal Information on the Site should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.</p>

<p><b>Access/Accuracy</b></p>

<p>To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Painreform wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information, which you may verify or update.</p>

<p><b>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites</b></p>

<p>Our Site may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see at our Site. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements&#39; effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>

<p>Our Site may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.</p>

<p><b>Children&#39;s Privacy</b></p>

<p>The Site is not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.</p>

<p><b>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</b></p>

<p>In the event that Painreform is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors&#39; rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>

<p><b>Commitment</b></p>

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and Painreform&#39;s Sites are constantly evolving to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy or its implementation, please contact us at info@painreform.com. <b>While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.</b></p>

<p><b>Your Consent</b></p>

<p>By using this Site, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy and to Painreform&#39;s processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.</p>
