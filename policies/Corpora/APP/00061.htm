            <div class=" h5 color2">QITLabs does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy of GPS satellite data, which is provided by a third party. QITLabs does not guarantee the accessibility of GPS satellite services. Furthermore, when these services are unavailable, locations provided will be approximate and provided by wifi network localization.</div>
            <div class=" h5 color2">An internet connection is not required to collect location data, but is required to send locations the the user’s account. QITLabs does not assume any responsibility for lapses in location updates due to lack of device connectivity to a wifi or 3G network.</div>
            <div class=" h5 color2">Depending on the model and manufacturer of the mobile devices, GPS location services will occupy more or less battery usage. QITlabs GPS tracking applications run in the background and keep the device from shutting down or sleeping (allowing the application to continually gather device locations). This can have a significant effect on the battery-life of the mobile device.</div>
            <div class=" h5 color2">Mobile phone tracker applications always appear in the applications list and can be uninstalled by the user at any time. Therefore, QITLabs assumes no responsibility for lack of functionality due to the uninstallation of the application by the user.</div>
