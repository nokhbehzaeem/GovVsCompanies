                     How We Obtain Information
                 <p>
                     Through registration forms, online surveys and through your use of our mobile apps we may obtain
                     information from you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     We will endeavour to make it clear when we are obtaining information from you.

                     What information we collect
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     The information that we collect about you depends upon your interaction with our website, apps and services, and may consist
                     of all or any of the following:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Your name</li>
                     <li>Your email address</li>
                     <li>Your physical (real-world) address</li>
                     <li>Your GPS location (not stored - see below)</li>

                     Location (GPS) information
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     We sometimes need to use your physical (GPS) location, e.g. when you are using one of our mobile apps.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     For example, if you are using our 'Bus Checker' app, we may need to send your location to our servers so that we can display a list of
                     nearby bus stops to you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Information about your location is <strong>never stored by us</strong> and we do not share it with any third parties.

                     How We Use Information
                 <p>
                     We will never share your personal information with any other party without your
                     permission except for the sole purpose of data verification and supplementation.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     The personal information you provide is used both for verification purposes and
                     to ensure that the information and content you receive is both relevant and accurate.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     From time to time, we may use your email address to contact you with updates or offers that we believe are interesting and         relevant to you.  We will ensure that you are able to opt-out of receiving these emails, both at the time of registration (if possible) and also by clicking an 'opt out' link within the emails themselves.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     We may research and report on our users' demographics, and activities based on the
                     information we possess. In doing this, we will never identify you individually.
                     We may share these general statistics with advertisers or partners.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     We may need to send your personal information to other countries for storage purposes on servers that we rent or own.
                     This includes countries outside the EEC.  Your data will not be available to third parties in these
                     locations.

                     How We Share Information
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Your personal information will never be released to any third party without your express
                     permission except in special circumstances such as when the law requires it or other
                     circumstances as detailed below.

                 <p>
                     We may share our research and reports with advertisers or partners.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Occasionally, we may use third parties to verify or supplement data. For example,
                     we may check that you are living at the address given by verifying this information
                     against information available for that purpose from other sources (e.g. electoral
                     rolls). We may also target offers to you by comparing your information with other
                     statistics to determine whether an offer is likely to be relevant to you. When third
                     parties are employed for these purposes, the confidentiality of your personal information
                     is maintained in strict conformity with this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Such
                     third parties will agree to maintain the confidentiality and protection of your
                     personal information, at all times during and after providing services.
