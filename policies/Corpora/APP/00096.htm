			<p>American creates a record for each booking that involves travel on American Airlines, even if the ticket is sold under another airline’s booking code. When you book travel on American, we will collect and store information about your transaction, including whether you booked your flight on aa.com or through another sales channel (such as a travel agency). American will also collect and store information about changes to your booking, including a cancellation or failure to complete your travel, upgrades, your baggage requirements, airport disruption, and lost baggage.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>If you book travel for someone else, we may collect your billing information but may communicate with the passenger directly about their flight.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>If your booking includes emergency contact information, we may share personal information with your emergency contact or attempt to collect information about you from your emergency contact, as appropriate based on the nature of the emergency.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>In the event of a flight delay, cancellation, or other service disruption, we may use the contact information provided in your booking to notify you, and the individuals traveling on the same booking, about the disruption.</p>

			<p>When you use our Services, we may receive technical information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, your geolocation, the name of your internet service provider, mobile advertising identifiers, and pages visited on our Services. American gets this information by using technologies, including cookies, web beacons, and mobile device geolocation to provide and improve our Services and advertising, including across browsers and devices (also known as cross-device linking). We also use this information to verify that visitors meet the criteria required to process their requests and for reporting activity on our Services.

			<p>For example, some of our Services include social network or other third-party plug-ins (such as Facebook’s "Like" button) that enable you to login to certain of our Services, to comment on content available on our Services, and to share things you find on our Services with your social network. The providers of these plug-ins may be able to collect information about you even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget and regardless of whether you have an account or other relationship with these social networks and third parties. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures to learn what information they collect, use, and share.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Also, some third parties collect information about users of our Services in order to provide interest-based advertising (on our Services and elsewhere, including across browsers and devices, also known as cross-device linking). This may include anonymized or de-identified information about you, such as travel destinations that you search for while using our Services. These third parties may use the information they collect on our Services to make predictions about your interests in order to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet (for example, travel products and services that are available at a destination you searched for online). Some of these third parties may participate in an industry organization that gives users the opportunity to opt out of receiving ads that are tailored based on online activities.</p>

					<h3>Our Services</h3>

			<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information you provide to us. Here are some things you can do to keep your information secure.</p>
		
			
					<h4>Keep your record locator confidential:</h4>
				
			
			
			<p>When you make a booking, you will be given a 6-character record locator, also known as a Passenger Name Record (PNR). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. You should keep your record locator confidential, as giving it to others may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others and do not want them to have access to your booking details, you should have each person make their own bookings.</p>
		
			
					<h4>Keep your AAdvantage<sup>&reg;</sup> account number and login information confidential:  </h4>
				
			
			
			<p>To make sure your access to our websites, other online services, and mobile applications is secure; you should not share your log in details with anyone else. You should always log out of the website, online services or mobile app after each use if others have access to your computer or device, especially if you are using a publicly accessible computer such as at library or internet café.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>American uses reasonable technical, administrative, and physical measures to protect your personal information from loss, interference, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current. When your personal information is shared, American will take a reasonable approach to prevent the unauthorized use of personal information.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Please note, however, that while American attempts to safeguard your personal information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, A THIRD PARTY'S UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT OR OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY, AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE GIVEN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE THAT DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS.</p>

These companies may send you offers based on the information you have provided us. Where we are required by applicable law, we will seek your consent prior to sharing your personal information with such third parties for marketing purposes.

			<p>In the event we undergo a business transition involving another company, such as a merger, corporate reorganization, acquisition, the lease or sale of all or a portion of our assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, information that we have collected from or about you or your devices may be disclosed to such other entity as part of the due diligence or business integration process and will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets.</p>
		

		

		
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>Legal requirements</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>Please note that the laws and regulations of several countries, including without limitation, the requirements imposed under the Transportation Security Administration Secure Flight program, require us to provide foreign and domestic government agencies with access to the personal information you disclose to us and data that we have about you and your travel plans, history, or status, including both before and after a flight arrives. For example, American and other airlines comply with legal obligations in the United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (UK) and other countries to provide border control agencies and customs authorities with access to booking and travel data when you fly to and from such countries, including stopover or layover destinations or countries that you may overfly en route to your destination. American does not have control or knowledge of the storage and use of that data after it has been delivered to the respective government entity. Further, to the extent required by law, we may disclose personal information to government authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to protect the rights or property of American, our customers, our services, or its users.</p>

			<p>American's websites do not honor web browsers' Do-Not-Track signals. You do have choices, however, when it comes to your privacy and internet browsing. As noted above, some third parties collect information about users of our Services in order to provide interest-based advertising elsewhere, including across browsers and devices (also known as cross-device linking). Some of these companies provide online users with the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices, please opt out through the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative website and also through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. Your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising. If you opt out, you will still receive ads but they may not be as relevant to you and your interests.</p>

					<h3>Controller of Personal Information</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>To the extent that American Airlines, Inc. is subject to the laws of the European Union and Switzerland when processing personal data (“Personal Data”), it shall be the “data controller” under such laws.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>If you have made a flight booking with us but one or more flights or services (including, for example, access to travel lounges operated by our partner airlines) are to be provided by other airline(s), then that other airline will also separately be considered a “data controller”. Your Personal Data will be processed in accordance with the applicable airline’s privacy policy and, if your booking is made via a reservation system provider (“GDS”), with its privacy policy. These are available at http://www.iatatravelcentre.com/privacy or from the airline or GDS directly. You should read this documentation, which applies to your booking and specifics (for example, how your personal data is collected, stored, used, disclosed and transferred).</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Any travel services provider (such as a hotel or car rental company) or AAdvantage<sup>&reg;</sup> participating partner (such as an AAdvantage<sup>&reg;</sup> co-branded credit card issuer) will also separately be a “data controller”. You can access the privacy policies of those providers from them directly.</p>
		

		

		
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process Personal Data includes processing that is:</p>
		

		

		
	

		

		

		
			
			

			
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
				
						
								
										
											<ul class="list-basic">
										
										
										
										
										
									
							
					
				
				
					
							<li>necessary for the performance of the contract between you and American (for example, to facilitate your travel on American under our conditions of carriage, to provide you with other services that you request, or for resolving billing or customer service inquiries related to your use of our Services); </li>
						
				
					
							<li>necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules or to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); </li>
						
				
					
							<li>necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the website and our Services); </li>
						
				
					
							<li>to protect the vital interests of you or another person (for example, if we collect and process medical information in the event of a medical emergency and you are incapable of giving your consent); </li>
						
				
					
							<li>to perform a task carried out in the public or substantial public interest (for example, to provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunity for air travel comparable to those of other persons); and</li>
						
				
					
							<li>where legally required and we have no other valid legal basis to process Personal Data, we will use consent by our customers (for example, to provide you with marketing information or share information with third parties), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing privacy@aa.com) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
						
				
				
				
						
								</ul>
							
					
			
		
	

		

		
			
												
						
			
			
			
					
						
					
						
						
								<p>
									<a href="mailto:privacy@aa.com" class="" >
										Email privacy@aa.com
										
											<span class="call-to-action" aria-hidden="true"></span>
										
									</a>
								</p>
											
					
					
				
		

		
	

		
			
			
			
			<p>In some instances, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services, and for you to use all the features of our website.</p>
		

		

		
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>International Transfers of Personal Data</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>The nature of American’s business means that the Personal Data collected through our Services will be transferred to the United States. Also, the American personnel and some of the third-parties to whom we disclose Personal Data (as set out above) may be located in the United States and other countries outside of the European Union or Switzerland, including in countries to which you fly and that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country. We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data, remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be requested by emailing privacy@aa.com.</p>

					<h3>Your Rights</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>As described above in the “Local Laws” section, under data protection laws in the European Union and Switzerland, you have certain rights related to your Personal Data.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>You may be entitled to exercise the right to:</p>
		

		

		
	

		

		

		
			
			

			
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
				
						
								
										
											<ul class="list-basic">
										
										
										
										
										
									
							
					
				
				
					
							<li>object to the processing of Personal Data (for instance, where the basis of our processing is our legitimate interests, see section above “Legal Basis for Data Processing”), and we will stop processing your data. We will not resume processing unless we can establish compelling legitimate grounds that override your rights.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data (for instance, this can be done if the Personal Data is not accurate and needs to be updated). This can also be done in relation to data where the purposes of processing no longer apply, but you still need the data and do not want us to erase it.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request updating of your Personal Data (if you believe the information we have about you is not accurate or incomplete). You may ask us to update your Personal Data but we cannot modify it for previously flown bookings because that is the official record of the transaction.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request access to your Personal Data (for instance, if you wish to receive a copy of your information, confirmation as to whether we are processing your information, and information as to how we use your information), You may request access to your Personal Data but that may not include information relating to others that you either did not provide to us or who have not consented to the disclosure of their information to you. </li>
						
				
					
							<li>request erasure of your Personal Data (for instance, if we have no legal basis to process the information and you have not given us your consent to do so, if the purposes of processing no longer apply, or if you have objected to the processing and we cannot establish compelling legitimate grounds to override your rights). Certain data may not be erased if we have a requirement to retain it for legal purposes, or if we have a contract with you as a member of AAdvantage<sup>&reg;</sup> or Business Extra (as we need to be able to perform contractual obligations owed to you). You may ask us to delete your Personal Data, but we cannot do so if you have a pending flight booked with us.  </li>
						
				
					
							<li>request portability of your own Personal Data (the transfer of information you have provided to us, to another controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format), if such a request is technically possible to complete.</li>
						
				
				
				
						
								</ul>
							
					
			
		
	

		
			
			
			
			<p>To exercise these rights please email us at privacy@aa.com.</p>

			<p>When we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will indicate what Personal Data we require from you to validate your identity. We will also provide information on the action we intend to take on the request in accordance with applicable law.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>We will respond to your request as soon as possible and no later than 30 days from receipt of the request. In certain circumstances this time may be extended by an additional two months, for example, where requests are complex or onerous. You may always contact our Data Protection Officer, at privacy@aa.com. If you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law, you may submit a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
