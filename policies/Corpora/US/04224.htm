                <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The Commission is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you.</li>
                <li>The Commission will not sell this information to anyone.</li>

            <h5>Use of Google Analytics and Other Services</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>This website utilizes Google services. Those may include Google Analytics and other Google services that place cookies (pieces of data) on a browser. These cookies help us increase the website’s effectiveness for our visitors. They are set and read by Google.</li>
                <li>Many sites across the web use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or applications on their sites. If you do not want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. </li>
                <li>For more information on Google services, please refer to: “How Google uses data when you use our partners” at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. </li>
                <li>In addition to using those employed by Google services, the Commission may use other “cookies” on this site. For example, when the Commission uses a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once should one be required, thereby saving time while on the website.</li>
                <li>Some areas of our website use performance monitoring services to measure the performance and usage of applications. The Commission will only use application monitoring information to maintain and improve our proprietary web applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Your Access To and Control Over Information</h5>

            <p>
                Wherever the Commission collects sensitive information, that information is transmitted to us in a secure way; however, the Commission is not encrypting personal information that you supply us. While the Commission uses encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, the Commission also protects your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which the Commission stores personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

The Commission encourages our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h5>Public Comments</h5>
            <p>The Commission offers the opportunity for the public to comment on projects and policies, and to provide general comments. These comments are collected via web-based forms. Once comments are provided, comments become public information within the public domain.</p>
