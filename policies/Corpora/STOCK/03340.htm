        <h4>Additional Information for California Residents </h4>
        <p>This section supplements the information contained in the other sections of this Privacy Notice and applies solely to clients, visitors, users, and others who reside in the state of California (“consumers” or “you”) and for whom we have data that is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as may be amended or supplemented from time to time (CCPA). This Privacy Notice, including this additional information, is provided to comply with the CCPA and other California privacy laws. Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this section.</p>
<p>Depending upon how you interact with us, you may have various rights in connection with our processing of your personal information, each of which is explained below. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Access</b>. You may have the right to confirm with us whether your personal information is processed and, if it is, to request access to that personal information, including the categories of personal information processed, the purpose of the processing, and the recipients or categories of recipients. We do have to consider the interests of others though, so this is not an absolute right and there are additional exceptions under the CCPA. Also, we are not obligated to respond to more than two access requests for the same individual’s personal information within a 12-month period.</li>
<li><b>Deletion</b>. You may have the right to ask us to erase personal information concerning you, except we are not obligated to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims or under other exceptions under the CCPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have a right to receive nondiscriminatory treatment for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. </p>
<p>To exercise one or more of these rights, please contact us as explained below. Please note that we may need to verify your identity before we can fulfill your request. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an online account with us, you must submit your request via the form after logging in. If you submit your form at <a href="https://www.troweprice.com/ccpa/index.html?van=CCPA" target="_blank">troweprice.com/CCPA</a> without logging in first, we will deny your request. When you have an online account and submit your request after logging in, we should not need further information from you to verify your identity, but we will let you know if we do.</li>
<li>If you have an account with us, but have not previously activated online access, you can submit your request by calling us at (844) 256-4465. Calling and having your account information available so that we can validate your identity will help us more efficiently handle your request. Or, you can submit your request via the form at <a href="https://www.troweprice.com/ccpa/index.html?van=CCPA">troweprice.com/CCPA</a>, and we will contact you as needed to verify your identity so that we can process the request.</li>
<li>If you do not have an account with us, verification can involve matching up to three pieces of your personal data (as provided on your request) with our internal records. You can submit your request via the online form at <a href="https://www.troweprice.com/ccpa/index.html?van=CCPA">troweprice.com/CCPA</a> or by calling us at (844) 256-4465.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we tell you that we need additional information to verify your identity, you must get us the information within ten (10) calendar days or we may deny your request. We will endeavor to respond to a verified request within 45 days, unless there are grounds for extending our response timeframe by up to an additional 45 days. In the event of an extension, we will explain to you why the extension is necessary. In some cases, your ability to access or delete your personal information will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law, even when the CCPA applies to the personal information we have for you. </p>

        <h4>Effective Date and Additional Changes </h4>
