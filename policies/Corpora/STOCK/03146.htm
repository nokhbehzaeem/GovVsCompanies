If you want to support us in improving the Extension, you can allow the Extension to transfer the above mentioned data to Flattr and eyeo GmbH by explicitly opting in to such a transfer. Depending on the status of our improvement, we may need different data. Such data will be restricted to the data listed in the Declaration of Consent and will be only transferred if you opt in to provide us with beta feedback. Please find the respective Declaration of Consent [here](#consent). You can opt out from this at any time in the settings of the Flattr extension.\n\nThree (3) months after you have sent it to us, we will delete your email address.\n\n## &lt;a name=\&quot;anonymization\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;Anonymization of your data when providing feedback\nIn order to protect your personal data, all URLs, page titles, domains (except the ones stated below) and authors of the content viewed on the respective domain will be replaced by an increasing series of numbers before sending the information to our servers, which are protected by TLS encryption. Thus, we do not know what you have been surfing, only the fact that you have been surfing. \n\nBecause we might develop customized solutions for multi-author platforms in order to pay out the respective author that has been flattered, the domains (and only the domains, not the URLs) of multi-author platforms, as but not limited to Youtube.com and Wordpress.com (full list [here](#domains), will not be replaced by an increasing series of numbers.\n\nWe do not combine the [Collected](#definitions) data with any other information about you.
