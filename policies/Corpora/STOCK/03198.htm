class="_-pk rich-text"><p>Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated Terms and Privacy Policy you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information that is easier to understand.</strong> Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy are easier to understand and reflect new features such as WhatsApp Calling and WhatsApp for web and desktop.</li>
<li><strong>We joined Facebook in 2014.</strong> WhatsApp is now part of the Facebook family of companies. Our Privacy Policy explains how we work together to improve our services and offerings, like fighting spam across apps, making product suggestions, and showing relevant offers and ads on Facebook. Nothing you share on WhatsApp, including your messages, photos, and account information, will be shared onto Facebook or any of our other family of apps for others to see, and nothing you post on those apps will be shared on WhatsApp for others to see. </li>
<li><strong>Your messages are yours, and we can’t read them.</strong> We’ve built privacy, end-to-end encryption, and other security features into WhatsApp. We don’t store your messages once they’ve been delivered. When they are end-to-end encrypted, we and third parties can’t read them.</li>
<li><strong>No third-party banner ads.</strong> We still do not allow third-party banner ads on WhatsApp.  </li>
<li><strong>New ways to use WhatsApp.</strong> We will explore ways for you and businesses to communicate with each other using WhatsApp, such as through order, transaction, and appointment information, delivery and shipping notifications, product and service updates, and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.</li>
<li><strong>The choices you have.</strong> If you are an existing user, you can choose not to have your WhatsApp account information shared with Facebook to improve your Facebook ads and products experiences. Existing users who accept our updated Terms and Privacy Policy will have an additional 30 days to make this choice by going to Settings &gt; Account. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users</h3>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS. IF YOU ARE A WHATSAPP USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION. FINALLY, THIS SECTION WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong></p>
<p>“Excluded Dispute” means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents). For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.</p>
<p><strong>Federal Arbitration Act.</strong> The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” section, including any question whether a Dispute between WhatsApp and you is subject to arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate for WhatsApp Users Located in the United States or Canada.</strong> For WhatsApp users located in the United States or Canada, WhatsApp and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. WhatsApp and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. WhatsApp and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at <a class="_36or" href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.adr.org</a>. The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Procedure.</strong> You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms; and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt-out:</p>
<p>WhatsApp Inc. <br>
Arbitration Opt-Out <br>
1601 Willow Road <br>
Menlo Park, California 94025 <br>
United States of America</p>
<p>You must include: (1) your name and residence address; (2) the mobile phone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our Terms’ agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.</p>
<p><strong>Time Limit to Start Arbitration.</strong> We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.</p>
<p><strong>No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, or Representative Actions for Users Located in the United States or Canada.</strong> We and you each agree that if you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Severability.</strong> If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” will be null and void as to that Dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Place to File Permitted Court Actions.</strong> If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the “Forum and Venue” provisions in the “Dispute Resolution” section set forth above.</p>

Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.</p>
<p>WhatsApp provides messaging, Internet calling, and other services to users around the world. Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information (including message) practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you. We also explain the steps we take to protect your privacy – like building WhatsApp so delivered messages aren’t stored and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.</p>
<p>When we say “WhatsApp,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about WhatsApp Inc. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>Please also read <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service" rel="noopener">WhatsApp’s Terms of Service</a> (“Terms”), which describes the terms under which you use our Services.</p>
<h3><a class="_36or" name="privacy-policy-information-we-collect" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#" rel="noopener" role="button"></a>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>WhatsApp receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.</p>
<h4>Information You Provide</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your Account Information.</strong> You provide your mobile phone number to create a WhatsApp account. You provide us the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You confirm you are authorized to provide us such numbers. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, profile picture, and status message.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your Messages.</strong> We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, files, and share location information) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services, which is on by default, when you and the people with whom you message use a version of our app released after April 2, 2016. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your Connections.</strong> To help you organize how you communicate with others, we may create a favorites list of your contacts for you, and you can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customer Support.</strong> You may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to our app performance or other issues.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Automatically Collected Information</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Usage and Log Information.</strong> We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our Services, how you interact with others using our Services, and the like), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transactional Information.</strong> If you pay for our Services, we may receive information and confirmations, such as payment receipts, including from app stores or other third parties processing your payment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device and Connection Information.</strong> We collect device-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, browser information, IP address, mobile network information including phone number, and device identifiers. We collect device location information if you use our location features, such as when you choose to share your location with your contacts, view locations nearby or those others have shared with you, and the like, and for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes such as if you are having trouble with our app’s location features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize our Services. For example, we use cookies to provide WhatsApp for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our FAQs are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, such as your language preferences, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#cookies" rel="noopener">Learn more</a> about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status Information.</strong> We collect information about your online and status message changes on our Services, such as whether you are online (your “online status”), when you last used our Services (your “last seen status”), and when you last updated your status message.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Third-Party Information</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Information Others Provide About You.</strong> We receive information other people provide us, which may include information about you. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number from their mobile address book (just as you may provide theirs), or they may send you a message, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third-Party Providers.</strong> We work with third-party providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with companies to distribute our apps, provide our infrastructure, delivery, and other systems, supply map and places information, process payments, help us understand how people use our Services, and market our Services. These providers may provide us information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services. If you use our Services with such third-party services, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Commercial Messaging.</strong> We will allow you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate with each other using WhatsApp, such as through order, transaction, and appointment information, delivery and shipping notifications, product and service updates, and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made.

<p>WhatsApp Inc. (“WhatsApp,” “our,” “we,” or “us”) provides messaging, Internet calling, and other services to users around the world, including the ability to send and receive payments through designated payment service providers (“PSPs”) in India (“Payments”) via Unified Payments Interface (“UPI”) developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (“NPCI”). Payments is a “Service” as defined in the WhatsApp <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> (“Terms”), and the following WhatsApp Payments Terms of Service (“Payments Terms”) supplement the Terms and apply to your use of Payments. You agree to the Payments Terms when you use Payments. </p>
<h3>About our payment service</h3>
<p><strong>Our Role</strong>. Payments is a service we provide through, and in coordination with, designated PSPs. We provide a convenient platform that enables you to submit transaction instructions to PSPs for processing via UPI. We are not a licensed financial institution, do not receive, transfer, or store any funds in connection with Payments, and are not responsible for UPI service interruptions or acts or omissions of PSPs or banks including the payment, settlement, and clearance of funds. You have a separate relationship with your bank regarding your bank account, and WhatsApp has no affiliation with your bank in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>PSP’s Role</strong>. When you send or receive funds through Payments, a designated PSP receives the instructions and processes the transaction via UPI. By using Payments, you will also need to agree to the PSP’s terms and privacy policy, which will be presented to you when you first use Payments. The PSP’s terms and privacy policy are also available <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#payments-payment-provider-in">here</a>. These Payments Terms govern the relationship between WhatsApp and you regarding Payments, and the PSP’s terms govern the relationship between the PSP and you.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>. To use Payments, you must use a phone number with the country code for India and have a bank account with a bank that supports UPI. The phone number you use for our Services must be the same phone number linked to your bank account used for Payments. </p>
<p><strong>Registration and UPI PIN setup</strong>. You must be an owner of the bank account you use to send and receive funds through Payments. After you provide information to confirm your mobile banking account, WhatsApp facilitates creation of a UPI ID (virtual payment address) that is associated with your WhatsApp account. Since your transaction instructions are processed via UPI, you must have a UPI PIN to send payments. We will ask you to create a UPI PIN to send payments if you do not already have one for your bank account.  </p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>. You must be at least 18 years old to use Payments. </p>
<p><strong>Credits</strong>. We may credit your bank account for purposes including rewards and special offers. Our affiliate WhatsApp Application Services Private Limited provides such credits on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and Taxes</strong>. You must pay any applicable fees arising out of your use of Payments, including any overdraft, transaction, or other fees charged by your bank, PSPs, or WhatsApp. You must comply with applicable tax laws in connection with your use of Payments, including reporting and payment of any taxes related to transactions made through Payments and any income received from such transactions. WhatsApp is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or other tax arising from any transaction you complete using Payments. </p>
<h3>Privacy policy and user data</h3>
<p>WhatsApp cares about your privacy. Our <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy-information-we-collect">Privacy Policy</a> applies to your use of Payments. Because additional information will be collected and processed when you use Payments, the WhatsApp <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#payments-in-privacy-policy">Payments Privacy Policy</a> also applies to your use of Payments. The WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy describes additional information practices applicable to Payments, including the types of information we receive and collect from you when you use Payments and how we use and share this information. If you use Payments, you agree to our data practices, including the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in our Privacy Policy and our Payments Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Use of payments</h3>
<p><strong>Payment Amount</strong>. You are responsible for the total payment amount. You must ensure that you have sufficient funds in your bank account before executing any transaction through Payments. Your payment will not be sent if the PSP or your bank determines that your bank account lacks sufficient funds to cover the entire transaction amount.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptable Use of Payments</strong>. You must access and use Payments only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes, according to our Terms and posted <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/commerce-policy/">policies</a>  including merchant policies as may be published from time to time. A PSP or WhatsApp may impose limits on your ability to send or receive payments, including transaction limits. A PSP or WhatsApp may also cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the Terms, these Payments Terms, posted policies, or the PSP’s terms. </p>
<p><strong>Purchase Transactions</strong>. If you use Payments to pay for goods or services, you agree to make legitimate purchases and to be bound by any terms of the sale. We have no responsibility for any goods or services purchased using Payments, including for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, chargebacks or disputes associated with transactions. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED USING PAYMENTS.</p>
<p><strong>Payments Transactions Are Final</strong>. Once you submit a payment, it is final. WhatsApp does not provide refunds or facilitate chargebacks. WhatsApp is not liable for unauthorized transactions. We assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds, or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender.</p>
<p><strong>Business Use of Payments</strong>. If you are a business and use our Services, you must comply with all applicable laws associated with your use of our Services, including Payments. You must clearly disclose any applicable terms and fees to your customers and promptly fulfill any goods or services you sell using Payments in accordance with any sale terms and applicable laws. WhatsApp is not a party to the transaction.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If there is any conflict between these Payments Terms and the Terms, these Payments Terms control solely with respect to your use of Payments and only to the extent of the conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>We may amend or update these Payments Terms. We will provide you notice of amendments to our Payments Terms, as appropriate, and update the “Last Modified” date at the top of our Payments Terms. Your continued use of Payments confirms your acceptance of our Payments Terms, as amended. If you do not agree to our Payments Terms, as amended, you must stop using Payments. Please review our Payments Terms from time to time.</p></li>

<p>The WhatsApp Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices. Our Services may include enabling you to send and receive payments (“Payments”), a service we provide through, and in coordination with, designated payment service provider (“PSP”) banks. </p>
<p>This Payments Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices when you use Payments. We use all the information we have to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. PSPs may also collect, use, and share information as set forth in their privacy policies, in conjunction with helping to provide Payments to you.</p>
<p>This Payments Privacy Policy supplements our <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, which applies to the use of our Services, including Payments. Please also see WhatsApp’s <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> (“Terms”), which describe the terms under which you use our Services including Payments, and the WhatsApp Payments Terms of Service (“<a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#payments-in">Payments Terms</a>”), which supplement the Terms, govern your use of Payments, and describe Payments in more detail. Please read all of these documents carefully.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>In addition to what is described in our <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, we receive information when we provide Payments.</p>
<h4>Information You Provide</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration and BHIM UPI PIN Setup Information</strong>. When you register to use Payments, you provide your bank’s name and confirm the bank account for use with Payments. If you do not have a BHIM UPI PIN already for your bank account, you can set one using your partial debit card number, expiry date, PIN (if required by your bank), and bank-issued one-time password (OTP) to set up a BHIM UPI PIN. We do not retain Customer Payment Sensitive Data (partial debit card number, expiry date, PIN, OTP, or BHIM UPI PIN). WhatsApp does not have access to the BHIM UPI PIN because it is encrypted by Common Library (CL) software provided by National Payment Corporation of India.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Transaction Information</strong>. When you send, receive, or request payments, you provide or confirm transaction information such as the receiver’s name and BHIM UPI ID (virtual payment address), and payment amount. To authorize every payment you make, you need to use your BHIM UPI PIN. This payment transaction information is handled securely. WhatsApp messages sent with payments are delivered once the transaction has processed and are treated as described in our Privacy Policy. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Automatically Collected Information</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information To Enable Payments</strong>. We collect information when you send, receive, or request a payment, including the date and time and reference transaction number. When the sender makes a payment to a WhatsApp contact, we collect the sender and receiver’s names and BHIM UPI IDs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information We Receive From Service Providers, PSPs, And NPCI</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We work with service providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market Payments; provide customer support; and keep our system safe and secure. For example, we work with companies to assist with customer support, and we receive information from them that you provide over the phone or email. </li>
<li><strong>PSP Banks and NPCI</strong>. We enable Payments by working with multiple PSP banks and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to facilitate the movement of funds between the sender and receiver’s bank accounts. They provide us information about you or your Payments transactions in certain circumstances; for example, we may receive information about you or your transactions from a PSP such as information to confirm your registration, the payment sender or receiver’s name, account status and balance sufficiency, transaction reference IDs, risk or fraud alerts, and the like. BHIM UPI transaction information is stored in encrypted format. Please note that the PSP or NPCI’s terms and privacy policies will govern your use of its services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
<p>We use all the information we have to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. This includes using the information to provide Payments and customer support, to protect you and others using our Services from fraud, abuse, or other misconduct, and to review your account activity to determine whether you continue to meet our Terms and Payments Terms. WhatsApp works with the other Facebook Companies to provide Payments, including to send payment instructions to PSPs.</p>
<h3>Information You And We Share</h3>
<p>In addition to what is described in our <a class="_36or" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, you share your information when you use Payments, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market Payments. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Payment Senders And Recipients</strong>. You and people with whom you send or receive payments may store or reshare your BHIM UPI ID, name, or transaction information with others on or off our Services. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. In conformance with our relationship with PSPs, WhatsApp works with service providers including Facebook. To send payment instructions to PSPs; maintain your transaction history; provide customer support; improve, understand, customize, support, and market Payments; and keep our Services safe and secure, including to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, safety, security, abuse, or other misconduct, we share information we collect under this Payments Privacy Policy with service providers including Facebook. Facebook will have no access to encrypted BHIM UPI transaction information in clear format. When we share information with service providers, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PSP Banks and NPCI</strong>. We share information with PSPs and NPCI to help us operate Payments. The PSP and NPCI receive transaction information such as payment amount and BHIM UPI IDs, so they can facilitate the movement of funds between the sender’s and receiver’s bank accounts. Please note that when you use PSP and NPCI services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing And Deleting Your Information</h3>
<p>If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your Payments information, we allow you to do that through your payment settings or by deleting your WhatsApp account. With your payment settings, you may register additional bank account(s), deregister existing bank account(s) from your BHIM UPI ID, change the PSP bank, and clear your transaction history. When you delete your WhatsApp account, your bank account will be deregistered from your BHIM UPI ID automatically.</p>
