The names of other companies, products or services referred to on this website may also be trade-marks or trade-names of their respective owners and any unauthorized use of the trade-marks or trade-names of Pan American Silver Corp. or of any third party is strictly prohibited.</p><p><strong>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information</strong></p><p>Certain of the statements and information in this website constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian provincial securities laws.&nbsp; Statements containing forward-looking information express Pan American Silver Corp.’s plans, estimates, forecasts, projections, expectations, or beliefs as to future events or results and Pan American Silver Corp. does not intend, and does not assume any obligation to, update such statements containing the forward-looking statements or information. Generally, forward-looking statements and information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as plans, projects or projected, expects or does not expect, is expected, estimates, forecasts, scheduled, intends, anticipates or does not anticipate, or believes, or variations of such words and phrases, or statements that certain actions, events or results may, can, could, would, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved.&nbsp; All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements or information.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements or information on this website relate to, among other things: our estimated production of silver, gold and other metals; our forecast cash costs per ounce of silver; our estimated all-in sustaining costs per ounce of silver sold; our anticipated capital investments; our ability to successfully complete any capital investment programs and projects and the impacts of any such programs and projects; the completion and anticipated results of any technical reports or other evaluations; and any anticipated level of financial and operational success.</p><p>These statements reflect Pan American Silver Corp.’s current views with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Pan American Silver Corp., are inherently subject to significant operational, business, economic and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies.&nbsp; These assumptions include: tonnage of ore to be mined and processed; ore grades and recoveries; prices for silver, gold and base metals; capital, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; our mineral reserve and resource estimates and the assumptions upon which they are based; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation); no labour-related disruptions at any of our operations: no unplanned delays in or interruptions in scheduled production; all necessary permits, licences and regulatory approvals for our operations are received in a timely manner; and our ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.</p><p>Pan American Silver Corp. cautions the reader that forward-looking statements and information involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information contained in this website and Pan American Silver Corp. has made assumptions and estimates based on or related to many of these factors. Such factors include, without limitation: fluctuations in silver, gold and&nbsp; base metals prices; fluctuations in prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation); fluctuations in currency markets (such as the Canadian Dollar, Peruvian Sol, Mexican Peso and Bolivian Boliviano versus the U.S. Dollar); operational risks and hazards inherent with the business of mining (including environmental accidents and hazards, industrial accidents, equipment breakdown, unusual or unexpected geological or structural formations, cave-ins, flooding and severe weather); risks relating to the credit worthiness or financial condition of suppliers, refiners and other parties with whom the company does business; inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks and hazards; employee relations; relationships with, and claims by, local communities and indigenous populations; our ability to obtain all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals in a timely manner; changes in laws, regulations and government practices in the jurisdictions where we operate, including environmental, export and import laws and regulations; diminishing quantities or grades of mineral reserves as properties are mined; increased competition in the mining industry for equipment and qualified personnel; and those factors identified under the caption “Risks Related to Pan American’s Business” in Pan American Silver Corp.’s most recent Form 40-F and Annual Information Form filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities.&nbsp; Although Pan American Silver Corp. has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated, described or intended.&nbsp; Investors are cautioned against undue reliance on forward-looking statements and information.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements and information are designed to help readers understand management’s current views of our near and longer term prospects and may not be appropriate for other purposes.&nbsp; Pan American Silver Corp. does not intend, nor does it assume any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements and information, whether as a result of new information, changes in assumptions, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law.</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Mineral Technical Information and Cautionary Note to United States Investors</strong></p><p>This website, including the documents and materials posted thereon, has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws.&nbsp; Unless otherwise indicated, all mineral estimates included on this website have been based upon mineral resource estimates prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (‘‘NI 43-101’’) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum classification system.&nbsp; NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.</p><p>Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and information concerning mineralization, deposits, and mineral resource information contained or referred to herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, estimates included on this website have been based upon “measured resources”, ‘‘indicated resources’’ and ‘‘inferred resources’’.&nbsp; U.S. investors are advised that, while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities laws, the SEC does not recognize them.&nbsp; Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a ‘‘reserve’’ unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.&nbsp; U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of an “indicated resource” will ever be converted into a “reserve”.&nbsp; U.S. investors should also understand that “inferred resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility.&nbsp; It cannot be assumed that all or any part of “inferred resources” exist, are economically or legally mineable or will ever be upgraded to a higher category.&nbsp; Under Canadian securities laws, estimated “inferred resources” may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases.&nbsp; Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian securities laws.&nbsp; However, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute “reserves” by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade, without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.</p><p><strong>Currency of Website</strong></p><p>Pan American Silver Corp. takes considerable care and effort to review and, where it deems appropriate and/or it is legally required, to update the information on this website. However, such information is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all matters and developments concerning Pan American Silver Corp. and Pan American Silver Corp. cannot guarantee the accuracy, currency or completeness of the information and assumes no responsibility in this regard.
