<strong><a name="targeted">Targeted Advertising Opt Out</a></strong><br /><br />
The online advertising industry provides a service through which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from certain data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.

Even if you opt out of targeted advertising, you may continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities. Please note, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your desktop computer’s browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device.
<br /><br />
<strong>Do Not Track</strong><br /><br /> 
Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” (a/k/a/ DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. For more information about “do not track”, go to <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target=_"blank">https://allaboutdnt.com/</a>.
<br /><br />
<strong><a name="retention">5.	SECURITY AND RETENTION</a></strong>
<br /><br />
We follow generally accepted standards designed to protect your information and have in place appropriate security measures designed to prevent your information from being accidentally lost or used or accessed in an unauthorized way. We use appropriate security measures while your information is in transit and at rest, including encryption. You can verify whether a website is secure by looking for “https” at the beginning of the web address of the Site page you are on.
<br /><br />
No website, however, can guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access. Except as expressly required by applicable statute or regulation, we will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.   
<br /><br />
We typically keep information related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and on request, we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law. For information that we collect and process for other purposes, as described above, we typically keep such information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations. In some cases we may de-identify your data instead of deleting it.
<br /><br />
<strong><a name="social">6.	 SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES AND OTHER WEBSITES, APPS AND SERVICES</a></strong>
<br /><br />
We use social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to communicate with our customers and integrate social networking services with our Site. Information you voluntarily submit to or post in a publicly accessible social network or other online forum may be viewed and used by others. Our Site may also contain links, banners or ads that lead to other third party sites, apps or services. We cannot control such third party uses of your information, so by using or navigating to those services, you assume that risk.
<br /><br />
We encourage you to read the policies and terms of every web site, app or service you visit.
<br /><br />
<strong><a name="additional">7.	ADDITIONAL EU DISCLOSURES</a></strong>
<br /><br />
IF YOU ARE SITUATED IN THE EU, THIS SECTION APPLIES TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND ADDITIONAL RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
<br /><br />
<strong>Data Controller</strong><br/><br />
Scholastic Inc. is the data controller of all Personal Data collected through our Site. If you are situated in the EU and have any complaints regarding our privacy practices, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to your local supervisory authority.

If you have a complaint, please contact us at: <a href="privacy@scholastic.com" target="_blank">privacy@scholastic.com</a>.
<br /><br />
<strong>Legal Basis of Processing</strong><br/><br />
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of your Personal Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including: (1) as necessary to perform a contract (which may include responding to your requests); (2) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for record keeping to satisfy legal and compliance obligations); (3) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for marketing); and (4) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain or improve our business generally or to prevent fraud) to the extent permitted by law. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Affiliates, Promotional Partners and Other Third Parties</strong><br/><br />
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain uses of your information, particularly around marketing and advertising:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Promotional offers from us: We may use your information to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You may receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or used our services and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</li>
<li>Third-party marketing: We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your information with any company outside our company for marketing purposes. </li>
</uL>
To see how you can opt out of marketing communications, please see the “Opt Out” section above.
<br /><br />
<strong>Data Subject Access Rights</strong>
<br /><br />
If you are a situated in the EU, under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as a data subject, you have the right to: 
<ul>
<li>Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").</li>
<li>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. </li>
<li>Request erasure of your Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it; where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below); or where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. </li>
<li>Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing of your Personal Data in certain scenarios.</li>
<li>Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
</ul>
To exercise your rights under the GDPR, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scholastic.com">privacy@scholastic.com<a/>. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Withdrawing your consent</strong>
<br /><br />
If we are relying on your consent to process your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scholastic.com">privacy@scholastic.com<a/>.
<br /><br />
<strong>Data Transfer</strong>
<br /><br />
Information provided to or collected by us on our Sites is transmitted to us and processed in the United States and other countries, either by us or our service providers on our behalf, and will be protected subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in other countries. To the extent permitted by law, your use of the Site or provision of any Personal Information constitutes your consent to the cross-border transfer of Personal Data and the other activities identified in this Privacy Policy. 
<br /><br />
Our affiliates and many of our service providers are based outside the EU, so their processing of your information will involve a transfer of data outside the EU. Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it.
<br /><br />
Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scholastic.com">privacy@scholastic.com<a/>. if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your information out of the EU.
