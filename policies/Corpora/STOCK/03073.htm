Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.

                Even if you delete your Site account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines' caching processes are outside of Mobiblocks’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.
