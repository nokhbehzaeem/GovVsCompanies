                <p><strong>Scientific Games</strong></p>
<p><strong>Website Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: December 31, 2019</strong></p>
<p>This website is developed and maintained by Scientific Games Corporation (hereinafter “Scientific Games,” “we,” or “us”).  The data controller is Scientific Games and can be contacted as explained below in the How to Contact Us section.  The data protection officer is:</p>
<p>Heward Mills<br />15 Old Bailey Rd., London EC4M 7EF<br />DPO@scientificgames.com</p>
<p>When you visit our website, official social media sites, or other online properties, collectively “Sites” or “Services,” Scientific Games may collect and use certain information about you.  Scientific Games recognizes that you care about how your information is used, and your privacy is important to us.  This Privacy Policy explains how we may collect and use your information, particularly your personal information, and the choices you can make about what information you share. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by our Sites and Services, including, but not limited to, all websites that post a link to this Privacy Policy.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  By continuing to interact with our Sites, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>If you are located in the European Union (“EU”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”)</strong>, this Privacy Policy also informs you about the management of your personal data and your rights in accordance with Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).</p>
<p><strong>If you are a resident of California</strong>, this Privacy Policy also informs you of certain privacy rights under California law.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We ask that you read this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Scientific Games may modify this Privacy Policy at any time in its sole discretion.  If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that increase our rights to use personal information we have previously collected about you or if we intend to process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data was first collected, we will provide you with additional information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing and obtain your consent where required by law.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT </strong></p>
<p>Scientific Games collects information about you when you interact with our Sites and Services.  When you use our Sites and Services, we collect information about one or more devices associated with you that you use to access the Sites, such as a computer, mobile phone, or tablet.  We collect, store, and use information you provide to us from one or more devices associated with you when you use our Sites, including when you log into the Sites or Services from one or more of your devices, register for an account, complete a web form, make a purchase, add or update your account information, apply for a job at Scientific Games, or otherwise correspond with us regarding the Sites.  Information that we collect includes your name, physical address, country of residence, email address, telephone number, language, social media information or profile, gender, and employment history information.  In addition, when you make a purchase through our Sites, either Scientific Games or a third-party payment processor will collect billing information, such as payment card information.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT </strong></p>
<p>We automatically collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Sites.  We automatically collect your device identifier, web browser type and version, IP address, and browsing information collected through cookies and beacons.  We also automatically collect information about how you use the Sites, such as what you have searched for and viewed on the Sites.  The information automatically collected will be associated with any personal information you have provided.</p>
<p>We collect certain information by automated means when you visit our Sites, such as how many users visited our Sites and the pages accessed.  By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Sites to our visitors.  We collect this information through various means such as “cookies” and “web beacons.”</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.  </strong>Like many companies, we use “cookies” on some of our Sites.  Cookies are pieces of code placed on your devices when you visit certain websites.  We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and to help us identify features of the Sites in which you may have the greatest interest.  Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular website.</p>
<p>Most web browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the features and functionality of the Sites.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons.  </strong>Certain pages on our website contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs).  These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears; the URL of the page on which the beacon appears; the time the page containing the beacon was viewed; the type of browser used to view the page; and the information in cookies set by the third party.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses.  </strong>An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.  When you visit our website, we view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.  We then use this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand the general locations of our website visitors.  We also use this information to enhance our Sites.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU </strong></p>
<p>We may use your information for the following purposes:</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT TRACK</strong></p>

<p><strong>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<p>If you are a California Resident, California law provides you with certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to know about personal information collected, disclosed, or sold. You also have the right to request that we delete any or all of your personal information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions, and the right not to be discriminated against if you exercise any of your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p>
<p>Scientific Games may have collected the following categories of personal information from California residents in the past 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers such as a name, postal address, IP address, email address, or other similar identifiers.</li>
<li>Categories of personal information described in subdivision (e) of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1798.80.&amp;lawCode=CIV">California Civil Code Section 1798.80</a>.</li>
<li>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law.</li>
<li>Commercial information, including records of products or services purchased or considered.</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information.</li>
<li>Geolocation data.</li>
<li>Professional or employment-related information.</li>
<li>Education information.</li>
<li>Inferences drawn from any of the information identified above.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect this personal information from a number of sources, including from you directly and from consumer data resellers, and use it for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.  We may have disclosed the categories of personal information identified above to certain third parties for a business purpose over the past twelve months, including internet service providers,  data analytics providers, government entities, operating systems and platforms, and social networks.  Where we disclose information for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the business purpose and requires the recipient to keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except for performing the contract.</p>
<p>Scientific Games will not and has not sold personal information of California residents, including those under 16 years of age, to third parties for a commercial purpose in the preceding twelve months.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to Know</em></strong></p>
<p>California residents have the right to request that Scientific Games disclose certain information about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <strong>Requests to Know and Delete</strong> below for instructions), we will disclose to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
<li>If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, a list identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Right to Delete</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that Scientific Games delete the personal information that we collected from you and retain, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <strong>Requests to Know and Delete</strong> below for instructions), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Requests to Know and Delete </em></strong></p>
<p>To exercise your right to know and right to delete described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us using our Privacy Rights Request forms found at the end of this policy or you can e-mail us at DPO@scientificgames.com.</p>
<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you wish to submit a verifiable consumer request on behalf of another individual, such as a minor child, we will also need sufficient information to verify that the individual is the person about whom we collected personal information and that you are authorized to submit the request on their behalf.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know or delete your data twice within a 12-month period. Your request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or are an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will need to verify your identity before processing most requests, which may require us to obtain additional personal information from you. We will only use the personal information provided in connection with a request to review and comply with the request.  If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to verify or complete your request.</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
<p><strong><em>Response Timing and Format </em></strong></p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason for the extension.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above.</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request information regarding the disclosure of their personal information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year. We will provide you with a list of the categories of personal information disclosed and a list of the names and addresses of the third parties. To make such a request, please fill out our Privacy Rights Request form and select “Shine the Light” from the dropdown menu.</p>
