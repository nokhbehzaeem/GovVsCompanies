<p><span>The privacy and security of your information is very important to us. Whether you are booking a room or are a member of one of our loyalty programmes, we want you to trust that the information that you have provided to us is being properly managed and protected.</span></p>
<p><span>We have prepared this Privacy Statement to explain more about who we are and how we collect and manage your information.</span></p>
<h2>
Who we are
</h2>
<p>This Privacy Statement is issued by the InterContinental Hotels Group of Companies (collectively referred to as &ldquo;IHG&rdquo;,
&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; in this Privacy Statement), which includes the direct and indirect
subsidiaries of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and covers information collected and used by us in the course of our
business. When we mention "IHG", "we", "us", or "our" we are referring to the relevant company in the InterContinental
Hotels Group that processes your personal information.</p>
<p>Your information may also be collected and used by IHG-branded hotels. In most cases these hotels are independently owned
and their use of your information is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.</p>

                    <p>We are a global hospitality company with IHG-branded hotels in nearly 100 countries. We predominantly franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, independent third-party owners. We also operate a number of programmes that are related to our hotel business such as IHG Rewards Club, which is our core loyalty programme.</p>

                    <p>We franchise our brands to, and manage hotels on behalf of, third-party owners. Most hotels operating under IHG&rsquo;s brands are independently owned and operated by parties that have entered into a franchise agreement with IHG that allows them to use an IHG brand for the purposes of operating a hotel (referred to as &ldquo;Franchisees&rdquo; or &ldquo;Franchised Hotels&rdquo;). If you make a reservation through us to stay at an IHG-branded hotel, we will share your information with that hotel. However, as IHG-branded hotels are not owned or controlled by IHG, their use of your information will be governed by their own privacy practices and is only covered in this Privacy Statement where specifically noted.</p>

<h3>Information we collect and how we use and share it</h3>
<p>We collect and use personal information if you make a booking through our reservation system, stay at an IHG-branded hotel, participate in one of our loyalty programmes such as IHG&reg; Rewards Club or interact with us through our corporate site.  We generally collect this information directly from you, but in some cases we may collect your information from other sources.  For example, we occasionally run promotions where we ask IHG Rewards Club Members to refer a friend to the IHG Rewards Club.  In these cases we always ask members to make sure anyone they refer is happy for their personal information to be passed to us, and to direct friends to read this privacy policy if they want to find out more about how we use their information.  We also collect information through our third party service providers' use of technologies such as pixels, web beacons, tracking tools and similar technologies.  For more information please <a href="#using-our-websites-mobile-applications-and-other-technology">click here</a>.</p>
<p>You do not have to provide us with your information although in some cases, if you do not, it may mean that you are unable to use our services.  For example, we may be unable to complete any booking you may wish to make, or you may be unable to participate in our loyalty programmes.</p>

<strong>
Information we collect:
</strong>
We collect information from you when you make a booking through our reservation system or stay at an IHG-branded hotel.
Information collected during the course of the reservation and during your stay may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Your name, email address, home and business address, phone number, nationality and payment card information;
    </li>
    <li>
    Information relating to your membership in one of our services or programmes or those of our programme partners such
    as your IHG&reg; Rewards Club number or frequent flier number; and
    </li>
    <li>
    Information such as stay and room preferences made during the course of your reservation such as your preferred room
    type and specific requests to the hotel.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
This information may be provided to us directly when you make a reservation through one of our global reservation offices,
through our websites, directly at the hotel or through our mobile applications. In some cases we will receive this
information from a third-party, such as when you book through an online travel agency or if information is provided
directly to one of our Franchisees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How we use this information:</strong> We use the information collected from you primarily to fulfil your hotel reservation.
Prior to your stay this may include sending your information to the hotel or sending you pre-stay communications.
Following your stay, we may also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get feedback on your
experience.
</p>
<p>
In some instances where we have your consent or where permitted under applicable law, we may send you marketing
communications (which may include text messages or calls placed using autodialer technology) for products and services
that we believe would be relevant for you. We also may use information related to your stay to display targeted advertisements
on our websites or on third-party websites or to send you more relevant messaging. Additionally, we use this information
for purposes of aggregated trend and statistical analysis to evaluate and improve our products and services, plan
new hotel locations and services and other market research.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who we share your information with:</strong> We will share your information with the hotel you are staying at to
fulfil your reservation. We may also share your information with third-party service providers to provide services
in relation to our business as well as to help us improve our products and services. For example, we might use a
third party or a third-party product for the purposes of market research and data analytics, or share data with online
partners we work with, so we, or our online partners on our behalf, can communicate with you and serve advertisements
through their platforms or on other websites or platforms. In certain instances, subject to local consent requirements,
third-party service providers may also assist us with various marketing campaigns. These companies are authorised
to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also share your information
with third parties, including our IHG&reg; Rewards Club partners and other third parties, to extend special offers
about their own products and services to you. These parties have agreed to comply with our privacy requirements.
If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our global customer care offices
or the <a href="/en/contact-us/privacy-office">IHG Privacy Office</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also share your stay information with other third parties in circumstances such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or to protect the safety of hotel guests, employees,
    the public or IHG property;
    </li>
    <li>
    when disclosure is required to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, warrant or legal process;
    or
    </li>
    <li>
    in the event of a merger, asset sale, or other related transaction.
    </li>
</ul>

Data transfer
</h3>

be necessary to transfer your information to a country outside of the country where it was originally collected or outside
of your country of residence or nationality. The information that you provide us during the course of a reservation or

around the world for the purposes of carrying out or facilitating these services. It will also be necessary to transfer
this information to third parties, including, without limitation, our Franchisees, partners and third-party service providers.</p>

protect your privacy rights:</p>
<ul>
    <li>transfers within the IHG Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the IHG Group (an intra-group
    agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your information receives an adequate and consistent
    level of protection wherever it is transferred within the IHG Group;</li>
    <li>where we transfer your data outside of the IHG Group including to other companies providing us with a service, we will
    obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your information. Some of these assurances are
    well recognised certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield for the
    protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States of America;</li>
    <li>we will only transfer personal information to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal
    protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights;
