            <h1>Couchsurfing.com Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>Effective Date: <strong>May 25, 2018</strong></p>

            <p>Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, disclose,
              protect and otherwise handle information about you. By using Couchsurfing services, you consent to the
              collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>This Privacy Policy describes:</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>the information we, Couchsurfing International, Inc. (“Couchsurfing”) collect about you,</li>
              <li>how we use and share that information, and</li>
              <li>the privacy choices available to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and
              other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”), or when you otherwise interact with us.
            </p>

            <p>From time to time, we may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the
              Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help
              protect your privacy.</p>

            <h3>What Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Services?</h3>

            <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>

            <p>We collect information you provide to us, such as when you create an account, update your profile, use
              the interactive features of our Services, participate in contests, promotions or surveys, request customer
              support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Basic user information, such as your name, username, gender, birth date, email address, mailing
                address, billing address, phone number and photographs;</li>
              <li>Messages and interactive forum information, such as discussion group posts, messages to other
                Couchsurfing users and information you provide in connection with activities and events;</li>
              <li>Other background, contact and demographic information, such as your occupation, personal URL, IM
                username, emergency contact, home descriptions, travel history and plans and other interests and
                self-descriptions you choose to provide;</li>
              <li>Information stored on your mobile device, such as your photos, calendar information and contacts, if
                you have given us permission to access this information; and</li>
              <li>Information about you from other Couchsurfing users, such as trust ratings, friend connections, public
                references, and other interconnections and interactions between you and other Couchsurfing users.</li>
              <li>Information provided to us by you as a part of the identity verification process. This includes the
                identity document and images used in the process, as well as the information included on the identity
                document provided.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>

            <p>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Location Information: We may collect information about your location when you access our mobile
                application or website, or otherwise consent to the collection of this information.</li>
              <li>Device Information: We collect device-specific information when you access our Services, including
                your hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information
                and information about the device’s interaction with our Services.</li>
              <li>Log Information: We collect log information about how you access or use our Services, including your
                access times, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
              </li>
              <li>Information Collected by Cookies and other Tracking Technologies: We may automatically collect
                information using cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking gifs,” “pixel tags” and “tracking
                pixels”) and other tracking technologies to, among other things, improve our Services and your
                experience, monitor user activity, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and tell
                if an email has been opened and acted upon.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>

            <p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through
              our Services. For example, if you create or log into your Couchsurfing account through a third-party
              social networking site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name,
              profile picture, connections and other account information in accordance with the authorization procedures
              determined by such third-party social networking site.</p>

            <p>Some of this information may be shared with other users. For example, they may be able to see your
              connections who are also Couchsurfing users.</p>

            <h3>How Do We Use this Information?</h3>

            <p>We use information about you for purposes described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise disclosed to you
              on or in connection with our Services. For example, we may use information about you to:</p>

            <ul>

              <li>Operate and improve our Services;</li>
              <li>Protect the safety of Couchsurfing users and provide our verification service;</li>
              <li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;</li>
              <li>Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;</li>
              <li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events and provide
                other news and information about Couchsurfing and other third parties;</li>
              <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Services;</li>
              <li>Personalize the Services, which may include providing content or features that match user profiles or
                interests;</li>
              <li>Process and deliver contest entries and rewards; and</li>
              <li>Link or combine with other information we get from third parties to help understand your needs and
                provide you with better service.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We retain the personal data you provide until your account is deleted. Account deactivation does not
              delete your personal data. In some cases we may retain certain information in anonymized or aggregated
              form.</p>

            <h3>Transfers of Your Personal Information Abroad</h3>

            <p>Couchsurfing may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries, where
              under local laws you may have fewer legal rights. However, wherever we store your information we will
              treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Couchsurfing International Inc. complies with the EU-U.S.
              Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department
              of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the
              European Union, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Couchsurfing
              International Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield
              Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield
              Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program,
              and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/"
                target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>

            <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>

            <p>We will not share information about you with outside parties except as described below or elsewhere in
              this Privacy Policy:</p>

            <ul>

              <li>With your consent</li>
              <li>With third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information
                to carry out their work for us; This includes <a href="http://www.onfido.com/"
                  target="_blank">Onfido</a>, the provider of our Identity Verification product.</li>
              <li>With others who access or use our Services in accordance with the privacy settings you establish </li>
              <li>With search engines in order to index the content you provide as part of a discussion forum or public
                profile;</li>
              <li>With partners who run contests, special offers or other events or activities in connection with our
                Services;</li>
              <li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or
                acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company;</li>
              <li>If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation,
                legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security or law enforcement
                requirements; and</li>
              <li>To enforce our agreements, policies, and <a href="/about/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> to protect the
                security or integrity of our Services; or to protect Couchsurfing, our users or the public from harm or
                illegal activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify
              you.</p>

            <p>Couchsurfing is responsible and liable if third-party agents that it uses to process the personal data on
              its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Couchsurfing proves
              that it is not responsible for the event that allowed the damage to occur.</p>

            <h3>Social Media Tools</h3>


            <p>Couchsurfing may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools which let you share actions you
              take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the sharing of
              certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the
              third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of
              data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy
              policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features. Couchsurfing may also allow you
              to access Google Maps. Please note that when you use Google Maps, you are subject to <a
                href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google’s privacy policy</a>, as
              amended by Google from time to time.</p>

            <h3>Third Party Links</h3>

            <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services as part of our
              Services. These third parties may have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no
              responsibility or liability for the activities of these third parties and how they collect, use or share
              information about you. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Services and welcome any
              feedback about these third parties.</p>

            <h3>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>

            <p>We may allow third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide
              analytics services in relation to the use of our Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and
              other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including
              your IP address and information about your web browser and operating system, pages viewed, time spent on
              pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Couchsurfing and others
              to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver
              advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better
              understand your online activity. Please note that we may share aggregated, non-personal information, or
              personal information in a hashed, non-human readable form, with these third parties. For example, we may
              engage a third party data provider who may collect web log data from you or place or recognize a unique
              cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies may reflect
              de-identified demographic or other data linked to information you voluntarily provide to us (e.g., an
              email address) in a hashed, non-human readable form. For more information about interest-based ads, or to
              opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a
                href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>

            <h3>How Do We Protect Visitor Information?</h3>

            <p>We take security of your data seriously and take reasonable measures to protect information about you
              from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
