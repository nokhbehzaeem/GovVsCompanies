These companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or as required by law.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information when (a) such disclosure is required by law, court of law, or as requested by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or law enforcement authority; (b) to the extent necessary for a reorganization, restructuring, merger, acquisition or transfer of assets related to our business; or (c) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our websites, databases, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of tangible and/or intangible property that belongs to us or to third parties.</p>
