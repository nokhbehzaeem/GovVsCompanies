<p><b><u>Vidyard</u></b></p>
<p>This websites uses “Vidyard” to host video content. Vidyard provides granular, user-based analytics about viewers of our video content by using in-browser technology to track content viewers (either localStorage or browser cookies).</p>
<p>The first time a viewer loads a Vidyard Player, we assign them a generated ID. This ID is then sent with each analytics update in order to track the individual viewers who have watched content. Browsers allow us to save this generated ID so that future viewing sessions from this viewer can be associated to the same generated ID.</p>
<p>Vidyard players are designed to keep track of how viewers behave, so every video hosted in a Vidyard player keeps track of everyone who visits.</p>
<p>Vidyard matches a viewer’s generated ID with the viewing behaviour data that the player captured. Vidyard then uses the generated ID to match viewers with any metadata that we know about them (such as email address or location).</p>

<p><b><u>LinkedIn Conversion Tracking</u></b></p>
<p>Insight uses LinkedIn conversion tracking to measure the impact of our paid advertising campaigns. The data collected enables us to see how our ads lead to valuable actions on our website such as content downloads, sign-ups, purchases and more.</p>
<p>The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to our website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics, timestamp, and page views. This data is encrypted, then de-identified within seven days, and the de-identified data is deleted within 90 days. LinkedIn does not share the personal data with Insight, it only provides aggregated reports about the website audience and ad performance. LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, enabling Insight to show personalized ads off its website by using this data, but without identifying the member. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their LinkedIn account settings.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20.0px;">Surveys</h2>
<p>The information you provide for surveys will be used to support your relationship with Insight. Insight may use online surveys to ask visitors/customers for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the survey taker information about our company and promotional material on behalf of our partners. We may combine survey information with other data we hold about you.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20.0px;">Contests/Giveaways</h2>
<p>The information you provide during contests and giveaways will be used to support your customer relationship with Insight. Insight may ask for contact information (like your email address). We use contact data from these events to send users information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners.

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20.0px;">Careers</h2>
<p>If you use the website to apply to work with us, the information you provide will be used to evaluate your candidacy for job opportunities with Insight and to monitor recruitment statistics. We provide electronic applications on our site in which we ask job candidates for contact information (like their email address) and information regarding work history and education. We use third parties to help us to do that. We use contact data from our applications to contact those individuals whose backgrounds most closely meet our requirements to schedule a personal interview. As a global business, we may transfer your details outside of your home country and to other Insight affiliated entities. Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held after the recruitment exercise has been completed and may be reconsidered should an appropriate position become available. Insight will follow the applicable law as to destruction and deletion of such personal information. We may retain de-personalized statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but individuals should not be identifiable from that data. Once a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to their employment. At that stage, we will give more details about how we hold employee data.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20.0px;">Information Disclosure</h2>
<p>Insight will not give or sell any information regarding you or your order and the products you purchase to any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent, save for the limited circumstances outlined in this policy. Your information may be shared with group companies, agents, contractors or vendors of Insight who provide data processing services to us or who otherwise process personal data for the purpose of performing services for you or Insight or for the purpose notified to you when we collected your personal data. Insight may release personal data (including personally identifiable information) when required to by law if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, in response to a lawful request by public authorities, a court order or legal process served on Insight.</p>
<p>Insight may also share your personal data with a potential or actual buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal data only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy, as well as any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information if we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of the business or assets. If Insight or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held may be one of the transferred assets. Any third party who acquires assets from us may acquire all or part of our business. They may not be in the same line of business as we are. Similarly, your personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the event of a reconstruction, liquidation or administration.</p>
<p><a name="security" id="security"></a></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20.0px;">Security</h2>

Accordingly you acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and that you provide personal information to Insight at your own risk. Insight cannot therefore guarantee the security or integrity of any personal data that are transferred from you or via the internet. Any user or third party accessing Insight’s website or services is responsible for its own use of the website and the services.

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
