<p><strong>4. Drivers</strong></p>
<p>In case your employer enters into a contract with PACCAR for Peterbilt SmartLINQ, Kenworth TruckTech+, DAF Connect, or any other data-logger, your vehicle will be monitored remotely. For example, PACCAR collects information in order to gather data from your vehicle. Although this data relates to the vehicle, rather than the driver, this data may become personal data and we might be able to indirectly identify the driver or define aspects of his or her driving behavior.</p>
<p>If you purchase a PACCAR vehicle equipped with a telematics system, PACCAR may also collect information from your vehicle on a real-time basis about its mechanical condition, such as diagnostic data, odometer readings, oil and fluid levels, tire pressure, fuel economy and its location (collectively “Vehicle Information”). PACCAR collects this information so that it can alert you to any mechanical or safety-related problem and provide you with support from its network of authorized dealerships.</p>

If you are a European citizen (either from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Russia, or Turkey) you can exercise your data privacy rights by contacting <a href="mailto:dataprotectionofficer@daf.com">dataprotectionofficer@daf.com</a></p>
<p><strong>1. The right to access, correct and receive a copy of your personal data</strong></p>
<p>It is important to us that the personal data we hold about you is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant and not misleading. To ensure we uphold this commitment, you have the right to access, correct or update your personal data at any time.

<p><strong>2. The right to data portability</strong></p>
<p>You are entitled to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format if we have processed your personal data for the following legal grounds:</p>
<p>a) You have given consent to us to process your personal data for a purpose that we have communicated to you beforehand; or <br /> b) We have processed your personal data in order to facilitate a contract with you; or <br /> c) We have processed your personal data using automated means (such as profiling).</p>
<p><strong>3. The right to deletion of your personal data</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete your data if: <br /> a) Your personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which we collected it; or <br /> b) You withdraw the consent that you had previously given us to process your personal data, and there is no other legal ground to process that personal data; or <br /> c) You object to us processing your personal data for PACCAR’s legitimate interests; <br /> d) The personal data is not being processed lawfully; or <br /> e) Your personal data needs to be deleted to comply with relevant legal requirements.</p>

The right to restriction of processing</strong> <br /> You have the right to request the restriction of processing your personal data if: <br /> a) You do not believe the personal data we have about you is accurate; or <br /> b) The personal data is not being processed lawfully, but instead of deleting the personal data, you would prefer us to restrict processing; or <br /> c) We no longer need your personal data for the purposes we collected it, but you require the data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or <br /> d) You have objected to the processing of your personal data and are awaiting verification on whether your interests related to that objection outweigh the legitimate grounds for processing your data.</p>
<p>If you wish to restrict our processing of your personal data, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to respond to your request in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>5. The right to object or withdraw consent</strong> <br /> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time if the processing is based on PACCAR’s legitimate interests.

<p><strong>Your Rights and Choices under the CCPA</strong></p>

<p>A. Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</p>

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>

<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with customer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation or a court order.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided the personal data.</li>
</ol><br />
<p>C. Exercising CCPA Rights of Access, Data Portability, and Deletion</p>
<p>To exercise rights under the CCPA, including rights of access, data portability, and deletion described above, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to PACCAR by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacting the Data Protection Department at 1 (844) 664-1999</li>
<li>Or emailing the Data Protection Department at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@paccar.com">dataprotection@paccar.com</a></li>
<li>Submit a letter to the address provided in the Contact Information section</li>
<li>Visiting <a href="https://www.paccar.com">www.paccar.com</a></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a twelve (12) month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows PACCAR to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. PACCAR cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>D. Response Timing and Format</p>
<p>PACCAR will respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your choice. Any disclosures that PACCAR provides will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable.</p>
<p>E. Non-Discrimination</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
