	</ul></p>
	<p name="marketing-purposes" id="marketing-purposes">

Tech Data ensures that such providers protect personal information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement and with applicable data protection laws.  These service providers may be located in countries other than your country of residence and may be prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose other than to provide assistance. If the service provider is located in a country other than your country of residence, we warrant that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure lawful and secure transfer of your personal information.</p>

In order to ensure an adequate level of data protection at those recipients of personal information, we implement appropriate measures for the transfer in line with applicable law.  For example, if personal information is transferred from a member state of the European Economic Area/European Union or Switzerland to another country deemed to not provide an adequate level of  protection according to European Commission, we implement appropriate contractual safeguards, such as Model Clauses, with such third parties or apply other appropriate safeguards as approved by the European Commission.  Further, if such third parties engage sub-processors in support of our agreement with them, the third party will be required to implement the same standards and safeguards with their sub-contractors.</p>
