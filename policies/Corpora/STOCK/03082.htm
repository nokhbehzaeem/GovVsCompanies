<p>Lawson Products Inc. ("Lawson Products") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.  This notice describes our Privacy Policy. This policy covers information collected on our website, <a href="https://www.lawsonproducts.com" target="_blank">www.lawsonproducts.com</a>,  and any related mobile websites and applications (collectively, the "Site") and information collected at our email address (<a href="mailto:info@lawsonproducts.com">info@lawsonproducts.com</a>) or our toll-free customer service telephone number (866.837.9908) or by our sales representatives (collectively, "Customer Service"). By visiting the Site or communicating with Customer Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  
    </p>
    
<p><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p><span class="italic">Information You Manually Provide</span>: Lawson Products collects information&#8212;including Personal Information&#8212;that you knowingly and manually provide when you use our Site or Customer Service. For example: 
    </p> <ul>
        <li>If you use a "contact us" form to ask us a question, we will collect whatever Personal Information you submit with or include in your question.</li>
        <li>If you order products through our Site or Customer Service, we will ask you to provide the information we need to process and ship your order, such as your email address, billing and shipping address and perhaps your credit card information.</li>
    </ul>
<p>The type of Personal Information we collect varies depending upon how you contact us and how you use our Site and Customer Service. </p>


<p><span class="italic">Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser</span>. We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages on our Site that you visit. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. 
    </p>
    <p>Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet. IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other Personal Information, but in some cases, they can be used to identify you. For example, if you have registered with our Site, we may link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally. We may also use IP addresses in connection with other information gathered elsewhere in an attempt learn the identities or general geographic locations of people who visit our Site. </p>

<p>If we suspect inappropriate or criminal activity or a threat to our Site or its users, we may share our server logs&#8212;which contain users' IP addresses&#8212;with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals. </p>

<p><span class="italic">Cookies and Similar Technologies</span>. Most websites use cookies and/or similar technologies to place information about a user's visit to that website in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer. In general, we use cookies and other web technologies to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>collect information about the ways visitors use our Site&#8212;which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;</li>
        <li>support the features and functionality of our Site&#8212;for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits; and</li>
        <li>personalize your experience when you use our Site, including by serving targeted advertisements. </li>
    </ul>

<p>Generally, the information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user account, we may link the information we collect using these web technologies to other information that identifies you personally. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may be able to set the browser of your computer to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is delivered. You may also be able to delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site.

<p><strong>Steps We Take to Safeguard your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information you submit on or through our Site or through Customer Service. Unfortunately, no website, server, or database is completely secure or "hacker proof." We therefore cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will not be disclosed, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of others. </p>

<p><strong>How We Share Your Personal Information With Others </strong></p>

<p><span class="italic">With Credit Card Payment Processors</span>. Our Site and our Customer Service permit you to use a credit card to order and pay for products online. We work with a third-party vendor to process your credit card payment. We accept Visa, Mastercard, and American Express using a PCI-compliant process. </p>

<p><span class="italic">With Other Third-Party Service Providers and Our Suppliers</span>.  Lawson Products shares information&#8212;including Personal Information&#8212;we collect with other third-party service providers and our suppliers.  For example, we may use third-party vendors to design, operate, and/or host our Site; to conduct surveys; to take and fulfill orders; and to help us with our promotional efforts. These third parties may need information about you to perform their functions. They are permitted to use your Personal Information only to perform services on our behalf. </p>

<p><span class="italic">In the Course of Business Negotiations</span>. We may contemplate, for strategic or other reasons, selling, buying, merging, or otherwise reorganizing our business. In negotiating with a third party about entering into such an arrangement, we may need to disclose your Personal Information. In such cases, we will take reasonable measures to protect the Personal Information we disclose, for example, by requiring a prospective purchaser to sign a nondisclosure agreement limiting the use and protecting the confidentiality of the Personal Information. </p>

<p><span class="italic">As a Result of a Business Transfer</span>. We may transfer the Personal Information you submit to any organization that acquires or merges with us. </p>

<p><span class="italic">To Comply With Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others</span>. We may disclose your Personal Information when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose your Personal Information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of our Site; to enforce or apply our online Terms of Use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others. </p>

<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>.  Our Site may provide links to other websites operated by third parties. We expect such third party providers of products and services to be transparent about their data protection practices. Be aware, however, that we have no control over third-party websites. This Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected on any third-party website. When you access third-party websites through a link on our Site, please take a few minutes to review the privacy policy posted on that site.</p>

We are continually improving and adding to the features and functionality of our Site and the services we offer.

<h2 id="tcsale">TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE <span style="float:right; font-size:12px"><a href="#" onclick="scroll()">top</a></span></h2>
<p><strong>Last Revised: January 24, 2017</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Lawson Products, Inc. ("Lawson Products"). Thank-you for doing business with us. The following Terms and Conditions of Sale apply to all purchases and sales.  Your purchase means you have accepted our Terms and Conditions of Sale in effect as of the date of purchase.  Please read these Terms and Conditions of Sale carefully. Any other terms and conditions contained in any customer purchase order are not binding unless expressly agreed to by an officer of Lawson Products in a separate document.  We reserve the right to impose purchase restrictions or limits at any time and to accept or reject any order. Lawson Products limits the sale of the products offered here to use by businesses and government entities. We do not sell to consumers.</p>

<p>Lawson Products' <a href="#tcuse">Terms of Website Use</a> and <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> can be found at <a href="https://www.lawsonproducts.com" target="_blank">www.lawsonproducts.com</a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. </p>

<p>Our catalog constitutes an original work. The catalog and the selections and arrangements of data therein compiled by Lawson Products are protected works and compilations under the U.S Copyright Act. All rights in Lawson Products, catalogs are reserved by Lawson Products. </p>

<p><strong>PRICING AND OTHER CHARGES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Product Pricing</strong>: Prices listed are wholesale and are effective upon publication (or immediately when displayed on our website) and are subject to change without notice. All prices are quoted in U.S. dollars. We reserve the right to pass on any surcharges. </p>

<p><strong>Other Charges</strong>: All orders are subject to applicable shipping, freight, taxes and processing charges. Shipping charges for ground service on all stocking orders are determined by using a flat rate table. This simplified table approach gives Lawson Products the ability to quote freight at the time of the order. Flat table charges are intended to approximate average cost to process and ship a package. In some cases, shipping charges may be less than or greater than Lawson Products' actual cost to process and ship.  There are no additional charges for split shipments on stocking orders. Shipping charges for non-stocking orders and premium shipping services will be subject to additional charges. Carriers may impose surcharges, which vary by carrier and may change at the carrier's discretion. Lawson Products will pass on surcharges to the customer. Freight rates and surcharges may vary by geographic location. This freight policy may change in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum Order</strong>: $50 (U.S. dollars). You may be charged the minimum $50 on any order with a merchandise value of $50 or less. </p>


<p>
    <strong>PAYMENT TERMS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Standard Terms</strong>: For open account customers with established credit, standard terms are 1% ten (10) days, net thirty (30) days from date of invoice. If an open account customer fails to make full payment within thirty (30) days from date of invoice, Lawson Products may defer any further shipments or other orders, or cancel any portion of an unshipped order. Lawson Products further reserves the right to charge interest on overdue invoices at the rate of 18% per annum (1.5% monthly) or at the highest rate available under applicable law. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars.  It is understood and agreed that you will pay, to the extent permitted under law, all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, collection agency fees and court costs incurred by us in connection with any collection action for payment of the amounts due herein.  Lawson Products has the right of set-off and deduction for any amounts owed by customer to us.</p>

<p><strong>Authorized Payment Methods</strong>: Lawson Products makes available certain payment methods through which you can provide payment information to us when you pay for your order ("Authorized Payment Methods").  Our Authorized Payment Methods are: providing payment information by telephone, providing payment information through our website checkout page, and providing payment information through a customer initiated electronic fund transfer. Lawson Products has implemented physical, technological and administrative safeguards to protect the information that you provide using one of these Authorized Payment Methods. If you do not use an Authorized Payment Method, and you submit payment information through some other method (such as via email or fax), then the safeguards provided by our Authorized Payment Method will not protect your payment information, and you provide such information at your own risk. We accept checks, C.O.D. and most major credit cards. We do not accept cash. </p>

<p><strong>Security Interest</strong>: Customer hereby grants to Lawson Products a first priority purchase money security interest and/or chattel mortgage in the products and any accounts receivable or cash from resale thereof until full payment is made to Lawson Products. Customer agrees to file, or permit Lawson Products to file, any financing statements or other appropriate documents with governmental authorities to perfect the validity, priority, and enforceability of Lawson Products' lien or security interest.</p>

<p><strong>DELIVERY</strong>: All orders are shipped F.O.B. from Lawson Products' distribution facility or manufacturer's facility for drop shipments. Title and risk of loss pass to customer on delivery to the common carrier or upon customer pickup.  Lawson Products uses various carriers for different regions. Other terms and conditions may apply for other than standard ground delivery ("Other Freight Services"), including, without limitation, expedited same day delivery, air freight, freight collect, export orders, hazardous materials, customer's carrier, shipments outside the contiguous U.S. or other special handling by the carrier.  Any charges incurred for Other Freight Services must be paid by customer.</p>

<p><strong>WARRANTIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Limited Warranty</strong>: ALL PRODUCTS SOLD ARE WARRANTED BY LAWSON PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS SOLELY FOR USE IN BUSINESS OR GOVERNMENT. LAWSON PRODUCTS WARRANTS PRODUCTS AGAINST DEFECTS IN MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP UNDER NORMAL USE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF PURCHASE FROM US, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED. IF A PRODUCT IS ACCEPTED FOR RETURN UNDER THIS  ONE YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY POLICY, WE MAY, AT OUR OPTION: (I) REPAIR; (ii) REPLACE; OR (iii) REFUND THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE PRODUCT. SUCH REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR REFUND OF AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE PRODUCT SHALL BE CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FROM LAWSON PRODUCTS.</p>

LAWSON PRODUCTS DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANSHIP, QUALITY, DURABILITY, SUITABILITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. LAWSON PRODUCTS ALSO DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR PRODUCT MISUSE, IMPROPER PRODUCT SELECTION, IMPROPER INSTALLATION OR PRODUCT MODIFICATION.  LAWSON PRODUCTS' OBLIGATION IS LIMITED ONLY TO REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE PARTS OR, AT OUR SOLE OPTION, TO REFUND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

<p><strong>Catalog Errors</strong>: Although all information in Lawson Products catalogs has been carefully checked for accuracy, errors and omissions occasionally occur and therefore are subject to correction. We regret any inconvenience.</p>


<p><strong>RETURN POLICY</strong></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with a product, please contact us.  We will promptly provide an exchange or refund (subject to quality assurance) for products returned (except for custom and hazardous materials) within ninety days of shipment that are in original packaging, in standard package quantity, in resalable condition and with proof of purchase from Lawson Products.  To return merchandise, you must request a Return Merchandise Authorization ("RMA") from our Customer Service Department which is subject to our approval. Some merchandise is excluded from return.  Exclusions include, but are not limited to, discontinued items, partial assortments, safety items, first aid items, consumable items, hazardous materials (including but not limited to lithium batteries, and flammable or corrosive substances) and specially ordered or custom made materials. Restocking fees may apply for items returned that are not in the standard package quantity, original packaging or in resalable condition or that have not been assigned a RMA. Customers are required to inspect all hazardous materials deliveries prior to acceptance of delivery. Once hazardous materials or non-hazardous materials that can become hazardous waste (e.g. broken light bulbs, leaking products) are accepted for delivery by you, Lawson Products is unable to take these items back. Shipping hazardous materials without authorization, using a Lawson Products prepaid return shipping label, can subject you to civil or even criminal penalties and fines by the appropriate federal agencies including the US Department of Transportation. </p>

<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Laws</strong>: Many states and localities have codes and regulations governing sale, offering for sale, distribution, construction, installation and use of products for certain purposes and/or containing certain regulated substances, which may vary from those in neighboring areas. Lawson Products relies upon information provided by its manufacturers and suppliers to ensure that the products are compliant with the laws of the jurisdiction into which the product is shipped. The information provided by the manufacturer/supplier as to the ability of the product to be sold or distributed in any particular jurisdiction is believed by Lawson Products to be accurate, however, Lawson Products shall not be responsible for how products are used or installed or for the product's conformance to national, regional, state, or local codes or regulations.  Customer has the sole responsibility for compliance with all applicable codes, regulations and laws regarding the purchase, use or installation of the products.
    The following are examples (but not a complete list) of prohibitions that may apply:
</p>
<p><strong>VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) Limits</strong>: Lawson Products may be prohibited from offering certain products due to restrictions or requirements of various federal, state, local and other authorities having jurisdiction in these matters. VOC restrictions may change without notice. Customers should consult the regulations applicable to these products to ensure compliance. Lawson Products relies on the manufacturer regarding the VOC content of their products and makes no representation or warranties regarding the information provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>California Proposition 65</strong>: Some products may contain certain chemicals and, therefore, be subject to warning requirements of California Proposition 65. Proposition 65 requires that packages of products containing certain chemicals identified by the State of California as causing cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm contain warnings. Lawson Products relies on the manufacturer regarding the hazardous chemicals in their products and makes no representations or warranties regarding the information provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury Containing Products</strong>: Some products may contain mercury and may, therefore, be subject to federal, state, or local regulations regarding their purchase, use, handling and/or disposal. Customers should consult the regulations applicable to their operations regarding these products. Lawson Products relies on the manufacturer regarding the mercury content of their products and makes no representations or warranties regarding the information provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Containing Products</strong>:  Some products may contain lead and Lawson Products may, therefore, be prohibited from offering, stocking or shipping them to/from certain jurisdictions due to applicable restrictions. Customers should consult the regulations applicable to their operations regarding these products.  Lawson Products relies on the manufacturer regarding the lead content of their products and makes no representations or warranties regarding the information provided by the manufacturer.
    </p>
<p><strong>Material Safety Data Sheet ("MSDS")  and Safety Data Sheet ("SDS")</strong> : An MSDS/SDS is a document that is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and provides specific Safety, Health and Environmental information about a product deemed to be hazardous (e.g. Hazardous Ingredients, Physical Hazards, Health Hazards, Safe Handling, Control Measures and more.) Manufacturers or importers are required to produce MSDS/SDSs and employers are required to have them available for their staff as per OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR. 1910.1200. Lawson Products expressly relies on the evaluation of the chemical manufacturer/importer of the products it offers for sale. LAWSON PRODUCTS MAKES NO WARRANTIES AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIBIALITY TO ANY CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURANCY OF THE INFORMATION OR THE SUITABILITY OF THE INFORMATION ON ANY MSDS/SDS.  CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY RELIANCE ON SUCH INFORMATION. MSDS/SDSs will be provided via the following means: (i) accessing Lawson Products' website (<a href="https://www.lawsonproducts.com/msds/msds-search.jsp" target="_blank">lawsonproducts.com</a>), (ii) using Lawson Products' toll-free number (866.529.7664) to request an MSDS/SDS by mail or facsimile, or (iii) contacting Lawson Products in writing requesting an MSD/SDS.</p>
<p><strong>Handling and Disposal</strong>: Numerous federal, state, and local codes, regulations and laws may apply to the disposal of products. Customer is solely responsible for proper handling and disposal of purchased items and should review and ensure compliance with all such codes, regulations and laws.</p>

<p><strong>EXPORT CONTROLS</strong></p>
<p>Lawson Products' products and services are subject to U.S. export control laws, regulations and administrative policies. Customer acknowledges that it is familiar with such laws and regulations and it agrees to abide by them in all respects. Diversion of products and/or services contrary to U.S. law is prohibited.  Customer understands that a license, written approval or other authorization may be required from the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State or other U.S. government agency prior to the export or reexport of these items from the United States.  Customer further understands that it is unlawful to export, reexport or transfer, or to attempt to export, reexport or transfer these items to individuals or entities on the List of Debarred Parties, Denied Persons List, Specially Designated Nationals List, Entity List, Unverified List or Nonproliferation Sanctions List, as well as sales or transfers to embargoed countries.  It is the customer's responsibility to be aware of these lists and embargoes. </p>

Nothing contained in these terms and conditions shall be construed to create a partnership, dealership, reseller, agency, employment or joint venture relationship.

Lawson Products and Customer will negotiate and agree on technical standards and methods to use in making EDI purchases, and will use reasonable security procedures to protect EDI records from improper access. In the event of a conflict, the business records maintained by Lawson Products regarding EDI purchases made by Customer shall be deemed to be conclusive.</p>

</p>
