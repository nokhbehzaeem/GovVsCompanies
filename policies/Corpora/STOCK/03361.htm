<p>During your visit to this website, you may come across links that will take you to third party website. These third-party businesses may use cookies, web beacons or other similar technology to collect information about you. Andersons does not control the content of or the information collected from these third-party websites. These third-party websites are not subject to Andersons&rsquo; Privacy Policy.

<h3>Monitoring, Enforcement, and Legal Requests</h3>

<p>Andersons has no obligation to monitor the website or the use thereof or to retain the content of any user session. However, Andersons reserves the right at all times to monitor, review, retain, and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request or to cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities in investigating a claim of illegal activity.

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Andersons sites are not directed to children under the age of 13.

<h3>Information for Individuals Located in the European Union</h3>

<h3>Legal Basis for The Processing of Personal Information from EEA Residents</h3>

<p>If you reside within the European Economic Area (EEA), our processing of your personal information will be legitimized as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Whenever we require your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;). This article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully.</li>
	<li>If the processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Andersons or for taking any pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b).&rdquo;). If this data is not processed, Andersons will not be able to execute the contract with you.</li>
	<li>Where the processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, we will process your information on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (c), for example complying in the fields of employment law.</li>
	<li>And where the processing is necessary for the purposes of Andersons legitimate interests, such processing will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (f), for example to detect fraud.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Transferring Personal Data from the EU to the US</h3>

<p>Andersons has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. A finding of &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; in short means that the European Commission has decided that this country outside the EEA ensures an adequate level of data protection. Andersons relies on derogations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR as the United States has no &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; decision and no other safeguards under the GDPR are in place (for example binding corporate rules on the transfer outside the EEA). Andersons collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data only: with your explicit consent; to perform a contract with you; in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. If this data is not processed and transferred, Andersons will not be able to execute the contract with you or you will not have access to any or all of the benefits and features associated with your transaction. Andersons endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Andersons and the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Andersons also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive information about you.</p>

<p>If you wish to confirm that Andersons is processing your personal data, or to have access to the personal data Andersons may have about you, please contact us at privacy@Andersonsinc.com&nbsp;</p>

<h3>European Union Data Subject Rights</h3>

<p>The European Union&rsquo;s GDPR and other countries&rsquo; privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects (persons that can be identified).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information about what personal data Andersons collects about you and how it is used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you wish to confirm that Andersons is processing your personal data, or to have access to the personal data The Andersons, Inc may have about you, or have other questions, please contact us at via privacy@Andersonsinc.com.</p>

<p>You may also request that Andersons cease using your data and withdraw consent for direct marketing purposes. In many countries (including EEA countries), you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how Andersons processes your personal data. When technically feasible, Andersons will&mdash;at your request&mdash;provide your personal data to you or transmit it directly to another controller. You have the right to receive your personal information in a structured and standard format.</p>

<p>In addition to the information contained in this Privacy Policy, you may be provided with additional and contextual information concerning services or the collection and processing of your personal data upon request.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, Andersons will provide you with a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, Andersons will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.</p>

<h3>Security of Information</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Andersons cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the Company, and you do so at your own risk. Andersons is not liable for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, once Andersons receives your transmission, the Company does its best to ensure its security on Company systems by making reasonable efforts to protect the information.</p>

<h3>How to Contact and Modify Your Information or Preferences</h3>

<p>If you have given Andersons information in the past and now wish to change or opt-out such information, you can opt out of communication by following the instructions within the text or email, or please contact Andersons at:&nbsp;</p>
