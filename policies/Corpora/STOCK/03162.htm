      <ul>
      <li>We collect certain information to offer you the eBuddy Services;</li>
      <li>We take security measures to safeguard this information;</li>
      <li>We use this information to enhance your use of the eBuddy Services, to improve these Services, to make them easier, better and more relevant and to keep you informed about news regarding eBuddy;</li>

If you are under sixteen (16) years of age you should discuss this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use with a parent or legal guardian and ensure that they agree with these before using any of the eBuddy Services. If you are under sixteen (16) years of age and you do not have this consent from a parent or legal guardian, you should not use any eBuddy Services. Please be advised that in your country of residence other age restrictions may apply.

      </p><h2>3. The information collected by eBuddy</h2>

      <h4>eBuddy.Lock</h4><p>
      When you use XMS you may provide us with your name, phone number, email address and allow us to access your address book.

      When using the Service you may exchange private messages (including, but not limited to text, images, videos, locations, contact details) with other users. These messages may be temporarily stored by eBuddy in order to be able to deliver them to the intended recipient(s). For example, when a recipient cannot be reached, the message may be stored on a server until the recipient uses the Service. We will delete the messages from our servers after successful delivery to all intended recipients. Please note that the message may be stored in the eBuddy application on your (mobile) device, and may be saved, modified, used or transferred by the recipient.
      </p><h4>Automatically generated information</h4><p>

      <li>and to ensure that the eBuddy service is protected.</li></ul>

      <p>eBuddy will take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect against loss, misuse or any form of unlawful processing. Information on eBuddy servers is stored in a secured manner and access is limited to authorized employees only. However, it is important to note that we cannot eliminate all security risks associated with data transmission and storage.
      </p><h2>6. Sale, merger or bankruptcy of the company</h2>
      <p>In the event of a further growth and development of eBuddy it may be that one or more parts of the assets of the company are transferred to a third party or that eBuddy merges with a third party. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, parts of the company may be transferred to a third party. In those cases, the information we have collected may also be transferred. In such an event, we make every effort to ensure that the entity that gains control over the information will commit to at least the same level of protection as described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p><h2>7. Transfer to countries outside the EU</h2>
      <p>It may be required for technical and operational reasons that the information we collect, including your (personal) details are transferred to servers in the United States or other countries outside the European Union where the regulations in the field of privacy protection might not provide the same protection as in the European Union. By using the Service you are giving your consent to this, in so far as your consent is necessary. Notwithstanding the above, eBuddy will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that the necessary measures and relevant controls are in place in order to protect the confidentiality and security of the information we collect, including your (personal) data.
      </p><h2>8. Viewing, changing or removing your personal information</h2>

You can also request us to remove your personal details from our servers.

      For technical reasons, it may be impossible for us to determine whether you have stopped using the eBuddy Services. For the mobile applications, it may also be impossible for eBuddy to determine whether you have deleted the application. In such cases, we reserve the right to remove your account and the information you have provided us if you have not used the Service for an extended period of time.
      </p><h2>9. Scope of eBuddy's responsibility</h2>

The eBuddy Services may contain hyperlinks or hyperlinks may be offered to you by other users or third parties, by which you leave the Service and go to the websites of third parties. eBuddy has no power over the websites of third parties to which you are linked to or from.

This Privacy Statement only relates to information collected through the eBuddy Services. eBuddy does not accept any responsibility or liability for (the operation and/or contents of) websites of third parties. Via eBuddy Services you can share information about yourself with others. You yourself are responsible for the information you spread via the eBuddy Services. eBuddy does not accept any responsibility or liability for this.
