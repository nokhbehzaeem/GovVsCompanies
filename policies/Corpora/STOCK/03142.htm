You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish                        them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection                        and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/103458">https://help.netflix.com/support/103458</a>)). </p>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>Removing device access to your Netflix account:</strong> To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices: (a) visit the &quot;Account&quot; section of our website, choose &quot;Sign out of all devices,&quot; and                        follow the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately) or (b) delete your Netflix settings from your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all devices). Where                        possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit.

If you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons                can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine                your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based ads from Netflix, please see the &quot;Cookies and Internet Advertising&quot; section (below).            </p>            <p><strong>Matched Identifier Communications.</strong> Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. A privacy protective                identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier to identifiers                in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication                to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.            </p>            <h3>Your Information and Rights            </h3>            <p>You can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you.            </p>            <p>You can most easily do this by visiting the &quot;Account&quot; portion of our website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Netflix payment                information, and various related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed and rated).

We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains                the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices regarding their use.            </p>            <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers</strong><br/><br/>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other                technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work                in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.<br/><br/>If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may                collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the &quot;Identifier for                Advertisers&quot; (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the &quot;Google Advertising ID&quot; on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers  are used to make online advertising more                relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes. </p>            <p><strong>Why does Netflix use these technologies?</strong></p>            <p>We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud;                to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites.</p>            <p>To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below:</p>            <ul>                <li>                    <p><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use                        our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.                    </p>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent                        you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and                        other information) about our visitors&#x27; use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality                        of our service.                    </p>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:</strong> These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver                        ads that are more relevant to you. These types of ads are called &quot;interest-based advertising.&quot; Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.                    </p>                </li>            </ul>            <p>In connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively “Advertising                Partners”), may receive limited information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information).</p>            <p>Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service.  Another common use is to make sure we                do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user.  </p>            <p>Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information                about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service.  </p>            <p><strong>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?</strong></p>            <ul>                <li>                    <p><strong>To exercise choice regarding cookies</strong><br/><br/>For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your                        online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, <a target="_blank" href="https://c.betrad.com/netflix/customlink.html?locale=en-US">click here</a>.                        At this time, we do not respond to web browser &quot;do not track&quot; signals.                    </p>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers<br/></strong><br/>To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices,                        please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;ads&quot; in your device&#x27;s settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to                        your likely interests.                    </p>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>To exercise choice using self-regulatory program resources<br/></strong><br/>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:                    </p>                    <ul>                        <li>                            <p>In the US: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a></p>                        </li>                        <li>                            <p>In Europe: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)</a></p>                        </li>                        <li>                            <p>In Canada: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/">AdChoices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC)</a> / <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/fr">Choix de Pub: l&#x27;Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)</a></p>                        </li>                    </ul>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>To exercise choice regarding other technologies</strong><br/><br/>There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB,                        and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser&#x27;s help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies,                        such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.</p>                </li>            </ul>            <h3><span id="ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Privacy Notice</span></h3>            <p>This Privacy Notice applies to California consumers and supplements the Privacy Statement.</p>            <p><span class="underline">Personal Information We Collect</span></p>            <p>We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household (“CCPA personal information”). We                have collected the following categories of CCPA personal information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months:</p>            <ul>                <li>                    <p><strong>Identifiers</strong>: “Identifiers” covers a broad range of information, including things like name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and IP address. We collect some CCPA personal information that falls into                        this category. For example, for streaming subscribers we’re going to have an email address, payment information (like a credit card), and for DVD customers we’re going to have a postal address. We collect IP addresses when you                        connect to our service online. These sorts of identifiers are connected to your Netflix account. There are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (resettable device identifiers, third party advertising cookies on                        our website) that we do not associate with your account, but that can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications.</p>                </li>                <li>                    <p><strong>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law</strong>: This covers a broad range of information like race, sex, marital status, among other protected classes. We will collect this sort of information                        about you if you choose to participate in our optional research surveys, or other research activity such as an in person interview or panel.
