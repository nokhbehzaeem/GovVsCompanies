We collect Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information in Consumer Requests submitted by Consumers directly from AutoWeb Sites or that were submitted by Consumers through Third Parties and that were acquired by us from the Third Parties in order to provide the Consumer’s Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information to a vehicle dealer, vehicle manufacturer or other Third Party that can contact the Consumer directly and provide the Consumer the product, service or information that the Consumer has requested or in which the Consumer may have an interest or to send the Consumer advertising, marketing or content.

Online behavioral information includes browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet Web site, application, or advertisement. Online behavioral information may be used to generate “<strong>interest</strong><strong>-based advertising</strong>," also called "<strong>online behavioral advertising</strong>,” which is advertising that is customized and targeted based on predictions generated over time from a Consumer’s visits across different websites, devices and mobile applications.

                  Anytime you visit AutoWeb Sites, we collect the Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer the AutoWeb Sites and track site usage statistics. A Consumer’s IP address may vary each time the Consumer visits, or it may be the same, depending on how the Consumer accesses the Internet. We also collect information on whether the Consumer reached an AutoWeb Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on a Third Party site, which helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. We also collect information on the Consumer’s ISP or mobile carrier and the type of handheld or mobile device the Consumer used.

                  “<strong>Advertising Networks</strong>” are Third Parties that serve interest-based advertising to Consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of interest-based advertising. AutoWeb engages with Advertising Networks that may use information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates and other advertisers. This data collection takes place both on the AutoWeb Sites and on Third-Party’s websites and mobile applications.

              <p>
                  Any Personal Information that AutoWeb collects is kept as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law or our recordkeeping policies and practices. When we no longer have reason to retain Personal Information it will be destroyed or anonymized in a manner designed to preserve its private and confidential nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                  AutoWeb has implemented commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical security measures designed to help protect the Personal Information stored in our systems against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. For example, we limit access to Personal Information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into access that information. We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to Personal Information. Technical measures also include use of firewall protection.&nbsp;We use TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption technology to protect Personal Information during transmission.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                  Some of our service providers may store information in servers hosted in countries outside the United States. As such, Personal Information may be subject to the laws of other countries, where the data protection and other laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the United States. Personal Information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities in the countries in which we operate.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Although AutoWeb has endeavored to create a secure and reliable networks, servers and databases that we operate or that are operated on our behalf, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and cannot guarantee protection of all information against interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that information may not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

                  A Consumer’s Personal Information is collected by a Third Party:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>When the Consumer initially provides the Third Party the Consumer’s Personal Information on a Third Party site and not on an AutoWeb site.</li>
                  <li>When a Consumer clicks on a link to a Third Party site from an AutoWeb Site, including clicking on an Third Party advertisement placed on an AutoWeb Site, the Consumer will leave the AutoWeb Site the Consumer was visiting and be redirected to the Third Party site.</li>
                  <li>When we sell&nbsp;or otherwise transfer or disclose the Consumer’s Personal Information to the Third Party, for example, when we sell a Consumer Request to a vehicle dealer to contact the Consumer regarding the information, product or services the Consumer requested.</li>
                  <li>When AutoWeb authorizes a Third Party to place the Third Party’s cookie or other Data Technology on an AutoWeb site.</li>
                  <li>When AutoWeb authorizes a Third Party&nbsp;to offer their products and services on AutoWeb Sites through use of a "framed" format, where the AutoWeb border will surround the pages served by the Third Party, or by directly linking the user to the Third Party’s sites. In either case, the Third Party is prominently identified.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  When a Consumer’s Personal Information is collected by a Third Party, the Third Party’s&nbsp;collection, use and sale or other transfer or disclosure of a Consumer’s Personal Information is governed by the Third Party’s privacy policy and terms of use. In addition, the Third Party is responsible for obtaining your consent under the TCPA if the Personal Information collected includes your telephone number (landline or mobile).&nbsp;Because we do not control the activities of Third Parties, we do not accept or assume responsibility for any collection, use, storage, or sale or other transfer or disclosure of Personal Information by such Third Parties or with respect to obtaining your TCPA consent, and we cannot represent or guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices or procedures as AutoWeb. We encourage Consumer’s to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any Third Parties to which a Consumer provides Personal Information or from which a Consumer requests information, products or services.

              </h3>
              <p>
                  The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides eligible California residents with specific rights with respect to our collection, retention, and use of Personal Information. This California Privacy Rights section supplements this Privacy Policy and applies solely to eligible residents of California as of January 1, 2020. Any terms not defined in this section have the same meaning as defined in the CCPA.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong><em><u>Right to Request and Obtain Information Regarding Personal Information</u></em></strong>. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1798.100 <em>et.seq</em>) (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”)&nbsp;entitles California residents to request information about the consumer’s Personal Information collected by the business in the 12 months preceding the request and concerning the categories of Personal Information; the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the Personal Information; the categories of third parties with whom the business shares Personal Information; and the specific pieces of Personal Information that a business has collected about the individual consumer. If the business also sells or discloses the Personal Information for a business purpose, in addition to the foregoing information, the consumer has the right to obtain the categories of Personal Information that the business sold about the consumer in the 12 months preceding the request and the categories of their parties to whom the personal information was sold (by category or categories of Personal Information for each third party to whom the Personal Information was sold); and the categories of Personal Information that the business disclosed about the consumer for a business purpose. These requests for information must be made by a “verifiable request” (as defined by the CCPA and the rules and regulations thereunder). California residents who wish to request the foregoing information in compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us as specified in the "How to Contact Us and Submit Requests" section below.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong><em><u>Right to Have Personal Information Deleted</u></em></strong>. &nbsp;The CCPA entitles California residents to request that a business delete all Personal Information about the consumer that the business has collected, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the CCPA.&nbsp;These requests for information must be made by a “verifiable request” (as defined by the CCPA and the rules and regulations thereunder). California residents who wish to request the foregoing information in compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us as specified in the "How to Contact Us and Submit Requests” section below.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong><em><u>Right to Opt-out From the Sale of Your Personal Information to Third Parties</u></em></strong>. &nbsp;The CCPA entitles California residents to direct that a business that sells Personal Information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s Personal Information.&nbsp;California residents who wish to exercise this right in compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us as specified in the "How to Contact Us and Submit Requests" section below. In addition, consumers may exercise this opt-out right by accessing the internet web page that we have provided at “Do Not Sell My Personal Information.”
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong><em><u>No Discrimination Against Persons Exercising Rights Under the CCPA</u></em></strong>. AutoWeb will not discriminate against any Consumer because the Consumer exercised any of the Consumer’s rights under the CCPA.&nbsp;Unless permitted by applicable law, we will not:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                  <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                  <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                  <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  We do not currently offer any financial incentives with respect to the collection of your Personal Information. However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result&nbsp;in different prices, rates, or quality levels. &nbsp; Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. &nbsp;Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.&nbsp;

                  <a href="mailto:consumercare@autoweb.com">consumercare@autoweb.com</a> or by calling via our toll-free number at (800) 267-2015.&nbsp;A two-step process will be used whereby the Consumer must first clearly submit the request to opt-in, and then second, separately confirm the Consumer’s choice to opt-in.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong><em><u>Request Fees</u></em></strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to requests unless they are excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. &nbsp;If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
              </p>
              <h3 style="font-size:13px">
                  <strong><em>Requests made on behalf of California Consumer (i.e., <u>Authorized Agents, Power of Attorney, on Behalf of Minors)</u></em></strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                  Only the Consumer, or an Authorized Agent that the Consumer has authorized to act on the Consumer’s behalf, may make requests related to the Consumer’s Personal Information. If a request is submitted by an Authorized Agent on your behalf, we will require that you provide the Authorized Agent written permission to do so and verify your own identity directly. The Authorized Agent will be required to submit proof that the Authorized Agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf. The Authorized Agent must also be registered as an Authorized Agent for CCPA matters with the California Secretary of State.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA require verification of your identity, and may be made only by you, your parent or guardian (if you are under 18 years of age), a person to whom you have given power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, or an authorized agent that is registered with the California Secretary of State. If a parent or guardian is submitting a request on behalf of a minor, the parent or guardian must submit proof that they are the parent or guardian of the subject consumer, and must verify the consumer’s identity (e.g., provide a notarized letter). &nbsp;If someone with power of attorney is making a request on behalf of a consumer, they must verify the individual consumer’s identity and submit documentation establishing the power of attorney. &nbsp;If an authorized agent is submitting a request on behalf of a consumer, they must verify the individual consumer’s identity, provide written permission from the consumer to submit the request on the consumer's behalf, and submit documentation establishing registration with the Secretary of State. If Autoweb cannot verify that the requestor is authorized by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf, Autoweb is not obligated to provide information or respond to the request. &nbsp;If you have any questions about making a request on behalf of another consumer, please contact&nbsp;our Consumer Care Department by calling via our toll-free number at (800) 267-2015. &nbsp;
