<h1><a name="b10"></a>COOKIES</h1>

<p>Cookies are tiny files or small pieces of data placed on your computer or mobile device by web page servers.  Cookies allow you to navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences, interests or log in details, and improve your overall experience.   Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver viruses and they cannot enable us to access your hard drive.  We cannot read any information on your hard drive even if we store cookies there.</p>

<h3><a name="b11"></a>Types of Cookies Used in Digital Media</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Necessary cookies:</b> these are essential to enable you to move around the Digital Media and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Digital Media. Without these cookies, our Digital Media would not work properly and services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or secure customer accounts, cannot be provided.</li>
<li><b>Performance cookies:</b> these collect information about how visitors use the Digital Media, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they receive error messages from web pages. These cookies collect non-personal information and are used to anonymously track visitor traffic or deliver a personalized, enhanced experience of the site.  We also use these cookies to test different designs and features for our Digital Media, as well as to help us monitor how our visitors reach our sites and how effective our advertising is.</li>
<li><b>Functional cookies:</b> these allow the Digital Media to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. </li>
<li><b>Targeting or advertising cookies:</b>  these are used to deliver content more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. Some of our partners may also use cookies or web beacons (a single-pixel image file) so that you see more relevant advertisements when visiting other websites. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</li>
<li><b>Social networking cookies:</b> these are usually set by the social networking provider and enable you to share content from the Digital Media with your friends through your favorite social networks.  They are also known as Social Media Plugins.  Perrigo does not control any of the content from our social networking cookies.  For more information about social networking cookies from social media websites you should refer to those sites' privacy and data sharing statements.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Learn more about how to manage cookies by visiting the Help function of your browser, the settings of your mobile device, or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target=_blank>www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which provides detailed information on managing cookies on popular browsers.  Please be aware that parts of our Digital Media may not function correctly if you disable cookies.  </p>

<h3>CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT</h3>
