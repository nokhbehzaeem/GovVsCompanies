    <h2>Dropbox Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>Posted: July 25, 2019</p>
    <p>Effective: September 24, 2019</p>

    <p>You can see your previous Terms <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms_april_2019" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks for using Dropbox! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working by providing an intuitive, unified platform to keep your content safe and accessible while helping you and those you work with stay coordinated and in sync. These terms of service (&ldquo;<strong>Terms</strong>&rdquo;) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites ("<strong>Services</strong>"). If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (&ldquo;<strong>North America</strong>&rdquo;) your agreement is with Dropbox International Unlimited Company. If you reside in North America your agreement is with Dropbox, Inc. Our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy2019" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use your information while our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you&rsquo;re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy2019" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Your Stuff &amp; Your Permissions</h2>
    <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and so on (&ldquo;<strong>Your Stuff</strong>&rdquo;). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don&rsquo;t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.</p>
    <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features, Dropbox accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.</p>

    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p> Your use of our Services must comply with our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. Content in the Services may be protected by others&rsquo; intellectual property rights. Please don&rsquo;t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.</p>
    <p>Dropbox may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/terms#acceptable_use" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. We aren&rsquo;t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.</p>
    <p>Help us keep Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current. Don&rsquo;t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.</p>
    <p>You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 (or older, depending on where you live).</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software (&ldquo;<strong>Software</strong>&rdquo;) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we&rsquo;ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p>

    <h2>Beta Services</h2>
    <p>We sometimes release products and features that we&rsquo;re still testing and evaluating (&ldquo;Beta Services&rdquo;). Beta Services are labeled &ldquo;alpha,&rdquo; &ldquo;beta,&rdquo; &ldquo;preview,&rdquo; &ldquo;early access,&rdquo; or &ldquo;evaluation&rdquo; (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox&rdquo;s other services. Beta Services are made available so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.</p>

    <p>Beta Services are confidential until official launch. If you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to anyone else without our permission.</p>

    <h2>Our Stuff</h2>
    <p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don&rsquo;t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others&rsquo; content in the Services, Dropbox trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.</p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/dmca" target="_blank">Copyright Policy</a>. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:</p>
    <p>Copyright Agent<br />
    Dropbox, Inc.<br />
    1800 Owens St<br />
    San Francisco, CA 94158<br />
    copyright@dropbox.com</p>

    <h2>Paid Accounts</h2>
    <p><em>Billing.</em> You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a &ldquo;Paid Account&rdquo;). We&rsquo;ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you&rsquo;re on an annual plan, we&rsquo;ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You&rsquo;re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we&rsquo;ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn&rsquo;t override these laws.</p>
    <p><em>No Refunds.</em> You may cancel your <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/158" target="_blank">Dropbox Paid Account</a> at any time. Refunds are only issued if <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/9069" target="_blank">required by law</a>. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account.</p>
    <p><em>Downgrades.</em> Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don&rsquo;t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features.</p>
    <p><em>Changes.</em> We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.</p>

    <h2>Dropbox Business Teams</h2>
    <p><em>Email address.</em> If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Business or Education team (collectively, &ldquo;Dropbox Business Team&rdquo;) or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.</p>
    <p><em>Using Dropbox Business Teams.</em> If you join a Dropbox Business Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization&rsquo;s terms and policies. Please note that Dropbox Business Team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox Business Team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox Business Team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into part of a Dropbox Business Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox Business Team.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>You&rsquo;re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>
    <p class="indented">(a) you&rsquo;re in breach of these Terms,</p>
    <p class="indented">(b) your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or</p>
    <p class="indented">(c) you don&rsquo;t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we&rsquo;ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>
    <p>We won&rsquo;t provide notice before termination where:</p>
    <p class="indented">(a) you&rsquo;re in material breach of these Terms,</p>
    <p class="indented">(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or</p>
    <p class="indented">(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</p>

    <h2>Discontinuation of Services</h2>
    <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Dropbox&rsquo;s control or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we&rsquo;ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems. If we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we&rsquo;ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p>

    <h2>Services &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don&rsquo;t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>WE DON&rsquo;T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO&mdash;THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX&rsquo;S OR ITS AFFILIATES&rsquo; FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN&rsquo;T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN&rsquo;T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON&rsquo;T BE LIABLE FOR:</p>
    <p class="indented">i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</p>
    <p class="indented">ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</p>
    <p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN&rsquo;T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p>
    <p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX.</p>

    <h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
    <p><em>Let&rsquo;s Try to Sort Things Out First.</em> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com. We&rsquo;ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
    <p><em>Judicial Forum for Disputes.</em> You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn&rsquo;t affect those requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>IF YOU&rsquo;RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented"><em>We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</em> You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this &ldquo;Mandatory Arbitration Provisions&rdquo; section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>
    <p class="indented"><em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/arbitration_optout" target="_blank">clicking here</a> and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.</p>
    <p class="indented"><em>Arbitration Procedures.</em> The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.</p>
    <p class="indented"><em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</em> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
    <p class="indented"><em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.</p>
    <p class="indented"><em><strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong></em>. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren&rsquo;t allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &ldquo;Mandatory Arbitration Provisions&rdquo; section will be deemed void.</p>

    <h2>Controlling Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn&rsquo;t override those laws.</p>

    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>

    <h2>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment</h2>
    <p>Dropbox&rsquo;s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>
    <p class="indented">(a) changes to the law,</p>
    <p class="indented">(b) new regulatory requirements, or</p>
    <p class="indented">(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</p>
    <p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we&rsquo;ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.</p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective. Where applicable, we&rsquo;ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>

  <p>Effective: January 1, 2020</p>

  <p>You can see the previous Privacy Policy <a href="/privacy2019">here.</a></p>

  <p>
    Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data
    when you use our websites, software, and services (&ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;). For
    more information and details, please see our
    <a target="_blank" href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq"
      >Frequently Asked Questions page</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h2>What &amp; Why</h2>

  <p>
    We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our
    Services.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Account information.</em> We collect, and associate with your account, the information you
    provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and
    set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and
    physical address).
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Your Stuff.</em> Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store
    your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (&ldquo;<strong>Your Stuff</strong
    >&rdquo;), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that
    possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This
    related information includes your
    <a target="_blank" href="/help/63">profile information</a> that makes it easier to collaborate
    and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was
    uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Contacts.</em> You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to
    do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the
    Services. If you do, we&rsquo;ll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Usage information.</em> We collect information related to how you use the Services,
    including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving
    files or folders). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and
    protect Dropbox users. Please refer to our
    <a target="_blank" href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq"
      >FAQ</a
    >
    for more information about how we use this usage information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Device information.</em> We also collect information from and about the devices you use to
    access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you
    use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your
    devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to
    the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and
    troubleshoot bugs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Cookies and other technologies.</em> We use technologies like
    <a target="_blank" href="/terms/cookies">cookies and pixel tags</a> to provide, improve,
    protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering
    your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and
    improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but
    this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your
    browser, we&rsquo;ll respond to that signal as outlined
    <a target="_blank" href="/terms/cookies">here</a>. We may also use third-party service providers
    that set cookies and similar technologies to promote Dropbox services. You can learn more about
    how cookies and similar technologies work, as well as how to opt out of the use of them for
    advertising purposes, <a target="_blank" href="/terms/cookies">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Marketing.</em> We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These
    free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services.
    If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about
    upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time.
    If you don&rsquo;t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the
    &lsquo;unsubscribe&rsquo; link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the
    <a target="_blank" href="/account/notifications">Notifications</a> section of your personal
    account.
  </p>

  <p>
    We sometimes contact people who don&rsquo;t have a Dropbox account. For recipients in the EU, we
    or a third party will obtain consent before reaching out. If you receive an email and no longer
    wish to be contacted by Dropbox, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list
    via the message itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Bases for processing your data.</em> We collect and use the personal data described above in
    order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use
    personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for
    other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such
    consent. For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our

  <h2>With Whom</h2>

  <p>
    We may share information as discussed below, but we won&rsquo;t sell it to advertisers or other
    third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Others working for and with Dropbox.</em> Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for
    example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us
    provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your
    information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we&rsquo;ll remain responsible for their
    handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we
    use to process your personal data and more details on the categories of personal information
    that we&rsquo;ve disclosed, please see our
    <a target="_blank" href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq"
      >FAQ</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Other Dropbox Companies.</em> Dropbox shares infrastructure, systems, and technology with
    other Dropbox Companies to provide, improve, protect, and promote Dropbox Company Services. We
    process your information across the Dropbox Companies for these purposes, as permitted by
    applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For more information on Dropbox
    Companies, Dropbox Company Services, and how your data is used, please see our
    <a target="_blank" href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/privacy-policy-faq"
      >FAQ</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Other users.</em> Our Services display information like your name, profile picture, device,
    email address, and usage information to other users you collaborate or choose to share with.
    When you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer
    or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making
    some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile picture, and email
    address—visible to other users on the same domain. This helps you sync up with teams you can
    join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
  </p>

  <p>Certain features let you make additional information available to others.</p>

  <p>
    <em>Other applications.</em> You can choose to connect your Dropbox account with third-party
    services––for example, via <a target="_blank" href="/developers">Dropbox APIs</a>. By doing so,
    you&rsquo;re enabling Dropbox and those third parties to exchange information about you and data
    in your account so that Dropbox and those third parties can provide, improve, protect, and
    promote their services. Please remember that third parties&rsquo; use of your information will
    be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Business Team Admins.</em> If you are a user of a Dropbox Business team (collectively,
    &ldquo;Dropbox Business Team&rdquo;), your administrator may have the ability to access and
    control your Dropbox Business Team account. Please refer to your organization&rsquo;s internal
    policies if you have questions about this. If you aren&rsquo;t a Dropbox Business Team user but
    interact with a Dropbox Business Team user (for example, by joining a shared folder or accessing
    stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email
    address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of
    that interaction. If you share Your stuff with a Dropbox team user, the administrator of the
    team account may have the ability to access and edit what you share.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Law &amp; Order and the Public Interest.</em> We may disclose your information to third
    parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any
    applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any
    person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users;
    (d) protect Dropbox&rsquo;s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried
    out in the public interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that
    your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it&rsquo;s stored on
    our Services or on your home computer&rsquo;s hard drive. We&rsquo;ll abide by the following
    <a target="_blank" href="/transparency">Government Request Principles</a> when receiving,
    scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for
    your data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be transparent</li>
    <li>Fight blanket requests</li>
    <li>Protect all users, and</li>
    <li>Provide trusted services.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We publish a <a target="_blank" href="/transparency/reports">Transparency Report</a> as part of
    our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This
    report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage
    you to review our <a target="_blank" href="/transparency">Government Request Principles</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="/transparency">Transparency Report</a> for more detailed information on
    our approach and response to government requests.
  </p>

  <h2>How</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Security.</em> We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for
    vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to
    things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices
    and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior
    and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.

    U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data
