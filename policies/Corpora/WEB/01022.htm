        <h2 class="faq-tabbed-article-title">What Type of Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?</h2>
    

    <p class="article-intro"></p>

    
        <p>We collect information to deliver the products and services you request, to help improve your shopping experience, and to support our business functions. We collect information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with our stores, websites, and mobile services. </p><p><b>What Information Do We Collect</b><br>We may collect the following categories of personal information. Not all categories may be collected about every individual:</p><ul><li>Personal identifiers, such as name and address</li><li>Device and online identifiers and related information, such as telephone number and email address</li><li>Internet, application, and network activity, such as cookie IDs and browser visits</li><li>Government identifiers, such as national identification numbers and driver’s license numbers</li><li>Demographic information, such as age and date of birth</li><li>Financial information, such as credit and debit card numbers and claims information </li><li>Health and health insurance information, such as prescription numbers and health insurance identification numbers</li><li>Characteristics of protected classifications under state or federal law, such as gender and nationality</li><li>Purchase history information, such as products you have bought, rented, and returned</li><li>Biometric information, such as imagery of the iris, retina, and fingerprints</li><li>Location information, such as geo-location information</li><li>Audio, visual, and other sensory information, such as audio and video recordings</li><li>Employment information, such as occupation, title, licenses and professional memberships</li><li>Background and criminal information, such as background checks and criminal convictions</li><li>Education information, such as degree and schooling information</li><li>Individual preferences and characteristics, such as inferences related to shopping patterns and behaviors</li></ul><p><b>How Do We Collect Information </b><br>We collect information from you in two ways: (1) information we receive from you and (2) information we receive from others. Information we receive from you includes: i) information you actively share with us, such as when you create an account on one of our websites, and ii) information you provide us passively through technology, such as through a cookie placed on your computer when you visit our websites. We also receive information from other sources to help us supplement our records, improve the personalization of our service to you, and detect fraud. Our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to support our business.</p><p><b>Information We Receive from You </b><br>You actively share information with us in various ways in our stores and online. For example, you share information when you: </p><ul><li>Make an in-store or online purchase, or other transaction, with us;</li><li>Create an account on one of our websites or mobile services;</li><li>Use a gift registry or create a mobile shopping list;</li><li>Participate in our programs, such as eReceipts;</li><li>Conduct a transaction or request a service where we collect information (including when required by law, such as hunting and fishing licenses);</li><li>Request customer service or contact us;</li><li>Post a review or comment on one of our social media pages, or post a rating, review or other user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile services; </li><li>Participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey; or</li><li>Use features of our websites and mobile services that may ask you to grant us access to the camera or microphone on your computer or mobile device (such as voice search or scanning bar codes).</li></ul><p>When you engage in these activities, you may share different types of personal information with us, such as your name, email address, physical or postal address, phone number, date of birth, and payment information.</p><p>You also passively provide us information in other ways through technology. Some of this information may be linked to you personally. This information helps our websites and mobile services work correctly and supports our customer marketing and analytics efforts – our work to understand our customers’ needs and provide information about our products and services. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><b>Device Information</b>: We collect technical information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services. This includes information such as Internet Protocol (IP) address, the type of mobile device you use, your device operating system and browser type, a unique device identifier, the address of referring websites, the path you take through our websites, and other information about your session on our websites.</li><li><b>Browsing Information</b>: We use our own and third-party technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and mobile device identifiers to collect information about the use of our websites and mobile services. We use these tools to provide an integrated and more personalized shopping experience for you. For example: cookies allow us to provide you relevant information as you use or return to our sites; web beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, an email was opened, or if ad banners on our websites and other sites were effective. Under certain circumstances, we permit third parties to collect information on our websites for their own business purposes using cookies, web beacons, iframes and similar technologies.<i> </i></li><li><b>Precise Device Location Information</b>: We may collect information about your location when your device is set to provide location information. For example, your device’s GPS signal allows us to show you the nearest Walmart stores. Other examples include allowing us to know when you are about to arrive to pick up your Online Grocery Pickup order after you check in. We may be able to recognize the location of a mobile device in stores where we provide customers free WiFi access or through the use of Bluetooth technology. Through mobile services, Bluetooth technology in our stores allows us to show you nearby products that may interest you, making it easier for you to locate products within and navigate through the store. <i>See “What Are Your Choices?” below for more information. </i></li><li><b>Facility Cameras: </b>We operate cameras in store for security and operational purposes, for example, to help us improve the design of our stores to better serve our customers. </li></ul><p><b>Information We Receive from Other Sources</b><br>We receive information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services and marketing to you, and prevent or detect fraud. We collect personal information from consumer reporting agencies in conjunction with products or services that involve financial risk to Walmart, such as transactions in which Walmart extends you financing. </p>

These choices are described below.</p><p><b>Marketing Preferences</b><br>When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:</p><ul><li class="MsoNormal">We use an opt-in standard for automated phone and text messages, and for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing of their products, such as sending you promotions for their products. Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent. </li><li class="MsoNormal">We use an opt-out standard for email, app notifications, and postal mail. Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below). </li></ul><p>Additionally, these standards may not apply to Walmart-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions. However, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to <span class="Enhancement" ><span class="Enhancement-item"><a class="Link"  title="Link: https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t"  href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t" target="_blank">www.optoutprescreen.com</a></span></span>. </p><p>If you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name, the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your related contact information. For instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address. Please allow sufficient time for your marketing preferences to be processed. It may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, app notification and sharing information with your consent. Please note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks. </p><p>Since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties, such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.</p><p>Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. Some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, or recalls. We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order. </p><p><b>Interest-Based Advertising Preferences </b><br>We personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. For example, if you browse or shop for electronics with us or on other sites, we may show you ads for electronics as you continue to browse the Internet. For more information about browsing information see <i>“Information We Receive from You.” </i></p><p>We show you advertisements related to Walmart or our advertising partners.
