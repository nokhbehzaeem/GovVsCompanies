<h3 id="how-we-share-the-information-we-collect"><a href="#how-we-share-the-information-we-collect">How we share the information we collect</a></h3>
<p>We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:</p>
<h4 id="with-your-consent"><a href="#with-your-consent">With your consent</a></h4>
<p>We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application Developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on GitHub to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization&#x2019;s access log.</p>
<h4 id="with-service-providers"><a href="#with-service-providers">With service providers</a></h4>
<p>We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements or making similar commitments. Our service providers perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. While GitHub processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our y service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our service providers are, please see our page on <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies">Subprocessors</a>.</p>
<h4 id="for-security-purposes"><a href="#for-security-purposes">For security purposes</a></h4>
<p>If you are a member of an Organization, GitHub may share your username, <a href="#usage-information">Usage Information</a>, and <a href="#device-information">Device Information</a> associated with that Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization who has agreed to the Corporate Terms of Service or applicable customer agreements, to the extent that such information is provided only  to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.</p>
<h4 id="for-legal-disclosure"><a href="#for-legal-disclosure">For legal disclosure</a></h4>
<p>GitHub strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. GitHub may disclose User Personal Information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data">Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data</a>.</p>
<h4 id="change-in-control-or-sale"><a href="#change-in-control-or-sale">Change in control or sale</a></h4>
<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Statement or Terms of Service.</p>
<h4 id="aggregate-non-personally-identifying-information"><a href="#aggregate-non-personally-identifying-information">Aggregate, non-personally identifying information</a></h4>
<p>We share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitHub, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">we may compile statistics on the open source activity across GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell your User Personal Information for monetary or other consideration.</p>
<p>Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&#x201C;CCPA&#x201D;) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, when it goes into effect we will voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to <em>all</em> of our users in the United States, not just those who live in California. You can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/githubs-notice-about-the-california-consumer-privacy-act">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-important-information"><a href="#other-important-information">Other important information</a></h3>
<h4 id="repository-contents"><a href="#repository-contents">Repository contents</a></h4>
<p>GitHub employees <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#e-private-repositories">do not access private repositories unless required to</a> for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, or to comply with our legal obligations.  However, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers and content to detect certain tokens or security signatures, known active malware, or child exploitation imagery. Our Terms of Service provides <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#e-private-repositories">more details</a>.</p>
<p>If your repository is public, anyone may view its contents. If you include private, confidential or <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/">Sensitive Personal Information</a>, such as email addresses or passwords, in your public repository, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
<p>Please see more about <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#public-information-on-github">User Personal Information in public repositories</a>.</p>
<h4 id="public-information-on-github"><a href="#public-information-on-github">Public information on GitHub</a></h4>
<p>Many of GitHub services and features are public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitHub and compile data as well.</p>
<p>Your User Personal Information associated with your content could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data. If you do not want your User Personal Information to appear in third parties&#x2019; compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your User Personal Information publicly available and be sure to <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">configure your email address to be private in your user profile</a> and in your <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address">git commit settings</a>. We currently set Users&apos; email address to private by default, but legacy GitHub Users may need to update their settings.</p>
<p>If you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#5-scraping-and-api-usage-restrictions">scraping</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#6-privacy">privacy</a>, and you may only use any public-facing User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and &quot;do not contact&quot; requests from GitHub or GitHub users.</p>
<p>Similarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available User Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. If you have a complaint about any User Personal Information on GitHub, please see our section on <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#resolving-complaints">resolving complaints</a>.</p>
<h4 id="organizations"><a href="#organizations">Organizations</a></h4>
<p>You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. If you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your User Personal Information. When you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-organization-membership">About Organization Membership</a>). If you accept an invitation to an Organization with a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/verifying-your-organizations-domain">verified domain</a>, then the owners of that Organization will be able to see your full email address(es) within that Organization&apos;s verified domain(s).</p>
<p>Please note, GitHub may share your username, <a href="#usage-information">Usage Information</a>, and <a href="#device-information">Device Information</a> with the owner of the Organization you are a member of, to the extent that your User Personal Information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.</p>
<p>If you collaborate on or become a member of an Account that has agreed to the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-corporate-terms-of-service">Corporate Terms of Service</a> and a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) to this Privacy Statement, then that DPA governs in the event of any conflicts between this Privacy Statement and the DPA with respect to your activity in the Account.</p>
<p>Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your User Personal Information in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete the User Personal Information stored in the Account.</p>
<h3 id="additional-services"><a href="#additional-services">Additional services</a></h3>
<h4 id="third-party-applications"><a href="#third-party-applications">Third party applications</a></h4>
<p>You have the option of enabling or adding third-party applications, known as &quot;Developer Products,&quot; to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your User Personal Information with third parties when you ask us to, such as by purchasing a Developer Product from the Marketplace; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it. You can check our <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/users/">API documentation</a> to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.</p>
<h4 id="github-pages"><a href="#github-pages">GitHub Pages</a></h4>
<p>If you create a GitHub Pages website, it is your responsibility to post a privacy statement that accurately describes how you collect, use, and share personal information and other visitor information, and how you comply with applicable data privacy laws, rules, and regulations. Please note that GitHub may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service.</p>
<h4 id="github-applications"><a href="#github-applications">GitHub applications</a></h4>
<p>You can also add applications from GitHub, such as our Desktop app, our Electron or Atom applications, or other application and  account features, to your Account. These applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all GitHub applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we collect the amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us</p>
<h3 id="how-you-can-access-and-control-the-information-we-collect"><a href="#how-you-can-access-and-control-the-information-we-collect">How you can access and control the information we collect</a></h3>
<p>If you&apos;re already a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">editing your user profile</a> or contacting <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a> or <a href="https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us">GitHub Premium Support</a>. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your  information current, or by contacting <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a> or <a href="https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us">GitHub Premium Support</a>.</p>
<p>If GitHub processes information about you, such as information <a href="#information-we-collect-from-third-parties">GitHub receives from third parties</a>, and you do not have an account, then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information by contacting <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a> or <a href="https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us">GitHub Premium Support</a>.</p>
<h4 id="data-portability"><a href="#data-portability">Data portability</a></h4>
<p>As a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you. You can <a href="/en/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop">clone your repositories to your desktop</a>, for example, or you can use our <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-24-user-migration-api/">Data Portability tools</a> to download information we have about you.</p>
<h4 id="data-retention-and-deletion-of-data"><a href="#data-retention-and-deletion-of-data">Data retention and deletion of data</a></h4>
<p>Generally, GitHub retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>
<p>If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your <a href="https://github.com/settings/admin">user profile</a>. We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request. You may contact <a href="https://support.github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a> or <a href="https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us">GitHub Premium Support</a> to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.</p>
<p>After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to other Users&apos; repositories and comments in others&apos; issues, will remain. However, we will delete or de-identify your User Personal Information, including your username and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with a <a href="https://github.com/ghost">ghost user</a>.</p>
<p>That said, the email address you have supplied <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address">via your Git commit settings</a> will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you choose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history &#x2014; the Git software is designed to maintain a record &#x2014; but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.</p>
<h3 id="our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking"><a href="#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking">Our use of cookies and tracking</a></h3>
<h4 id="cookies"><a href="#cookies">Cookies</a></h4>
<p>GitHub uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of GitHub. For security purposes, we use cookies to identify a device. By using our Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device&#x2019;s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use GitHub&#x2019;s services.</p>
<p>We provide a web page on <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies">cookies and tracking</a> that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the types of cookies they are (temporary or permanent). It also lists our third-party analytics providers and other service providers, and details exactly which parts of our Website we permit them to track.</p>
<h4 id="tracking-and-analytics"><a href="#tracking-and-analytics">Tracking and analytics</a></h4>
<p>We use a number of third-party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our Users&apos; use of GitHub, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and Website performance. We only use these third-party analytics providers on certain areas of our Website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of User Personal Information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.</p>
<p>Some browsers have incorporated &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. GitHub responds to browser DNT signals and follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/">W3C standard for responding to DNT signals</a>. If you have not enabled DNT on a browser that supports it, cookies on some parts of our Website will track your online browsing activity on other online services over time, though we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track GitHub Users&apos; activity over time on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="how-github-secures-your-information"><a href="#how-github-secures-your-information">How GitHub secures your information</a></h3>
<p>GitHub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.</p>
<p>GitHub enforces a written security information program. Our program:</p>
<ul>
<li>aligns with industry recognized frameworks;</li>
<li>includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our Users&apos; data;</li>
<li>is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of GitHub&#x2019;s business operations;</li>
<li>includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and</li>
<li>complies with applicable information security-related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where GitHub does business.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected Users without undue delay.</p>
<p>Transmission of data on GitHub is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS (TLS), and git repository content is encrypted at rest. We manage our own cages and racks at top-tier data centers with high level of physical and network security, and when data is stored with a third-party storage provider, it is encrypted.</p>
<p>No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more information, see our <a href="https://github.com/security">security disclosures</a>.</p>
<h3 id="githubs-global-privacy-practices"><a href="#githubs-global-privacy-practices">GitHub&apos;s global privacy practices</a></h3>
<p>We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement though our service providers may store and process data outside the United States. However, we understand that we have Users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries.</p>
<p>We provide a high standard of privacy protection&#x2014;as described in this Privacy Statement&#x2014;to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed, specific, and freely given consent at the time of data collection, when we collect your User Personal Information using consent as a basis.</li>
<li>We collect only the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>
<li>We offer you simple methods of accessing, altering, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected, where legally permitted.</li>
<li>We provide our Users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access regarding their User Personal Information, and we limit the purpose for processing it. We also provide our Users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cross-border-data-transfers"><a href="#cross-border-data-transfers">Cross-border data transfers</a></h4>
<p>GitHub complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of User Personal Information transferred from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland to the United States. GitHub has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-communicate-with-you"><a href="#how-we-communicate-with-you">How we communicate with you</a></h3>
<p>We use your email address to communicate with you, if you&apos;ve said that&apos;s okay, <strong>and only for the reasons you&#x2019;ve said that&#x2019;s okay</strong>. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through GitHub. You may manage your communication preferences in your <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">user profile</a>.</p>
<p>By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a User&apos;s email address, such as commit messages. We are not able to change many aspects of the Git system. If you would like your email address to remain private, even when you&#x2019;re commenting on public repositories, <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">you can create a private email address in your user profile</a>. You should also <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address">update your local Git configuration to use your private email address</a>. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you. We set current Users&apos; email address private by default, but legacy GitHub Users may need to update their settings. Please see more about email addresses in commit messages <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address">here</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on your <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">email settings</a>, GitHub may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you&#x2019;re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There&apos;s an &#x201C;unsubscribe&#x201D; link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.</p>
<p>Our emails may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we&#x2019;re not sending you unwanted email.</p>
<h3 id="resolving-complaints"><a href="#resolving-complaints">Resolving complaints</a></h3>
<p>If you have concerns about the way GitHub is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by filling out the <a href="https://support.github.com/contact/privacy">Privacy contact form</a>.

<h4 id="dispute-resolution-process"><a href="#dispute-resolution-process">Dispute resolution process</a></h4>
<p>In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and GitHub regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals. Please contact us if you&#x2019;d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>
<h4 id="independent-arbitration"><a href="#independent-arbitration">Independent arbitration</a></h4>
<p>Under certain limited circumstances, EU, European Economic Area (EEA), Swiss, and UK individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please read more about <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">Privacy Shield</a>. Arbitration is not mandatory; it is a tool you can use if you so choose.</p>
