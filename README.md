Comparing Privacy Policies of Government Agencies and Companies: a Study Using Privacy Policy Analysis Tools

We make our data, including links to all the privacy policies, their downloaded text used in the experiments, the results of running the tools on them, and the SPSS outputs publicly available.

# Repository structure 
The Corpora folder includes five text files, each containing the URLs of privacy policies of one corpus: EU, US, APP, STOCK, and WEB. This folder also includes five folders, each containing the downloaded html files of privacy policies of a corpus.

The Results folder has two sub-folders, named after PrivacyCheck and Polisis. Each of these folders contains a tab-delimited text file with the results of running the respective tool on all the five corpora. This text file is the input to SPSS. The output of analyzing data with SPSS, to run the chi-square test and calculate Cramer's V, is provided as a pdf file.
